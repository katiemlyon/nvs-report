Transportation networks connect local communities to refuges and are the bedrock of all experiences that occur on refuges. These networks include roads, bridges, foot pathways, entrances, and the entire suite of transportation features critical to visitor access and mobility. While many visitors arrive at the refuge in private vehicles, other options (including buses, trams, watercraft, and bicycles) are increasingly becoming a part of the visitor experience. Thus, there is a critical need to know how visitors perceive the safety of using these different transportation options, as well as different transportation features (e.g., bridges, roadways, entrances/exists) as part of their experience. The survey asked visitors to rate both the importance and current satisfaction with existing transportation-related features, as well as methods of transportation visitors used to get to and around the refuge during their visit. This information can help to identify if transportation improvements could be made that would further enhance visitor access and, ultimately, their overall experiences [@USFWS2011]. Additionally, transportation alternatives within the Refuge System [@krechmer2001; @volpe2010] could help to improve refuge conditions (e.g., quality of air, water, and habitat); thus, the survey asked visitors to note different transportation methods used during their trips, and their likelihood of using alternative transportation at refuges in the future.

## Travel To This Refuge

The key mode of transportation used by visitors to travel to this refuge was `r transLocal1` (`r transLocalProp1`%; fig. 11). The key mode of transportation used by visitors to travel around this refuge was `r transRef1` (`r transRefProp1`%) (##%).

**Figure 11.** Modes of transportation used by visitors to travel to and around `r paste(params$RefugeName)` during this visit (*n* = ###). See Appendix C for a listing of &quot;other&quot; modes of transportation. Modes of transportation with a proportion smaller than 1.5% for both items were excluded; see Appendix B for frequencies of all items.

## Alternative Transportation Options

One goal of the Transportation Program is to provide alternative modes and means of access to FWS managed lands as a way to enhance the visitation experience. "Access to FWS managed lands, where compatible with Station purpose, should be available to visitors via multiple forms of transportation, including public transit, bicycle, and walking. Alternative forms of transportation can help reduce visitors' carbon footprints, which in turn may have long term positive affects for the natural resources we manage. Planning and building to accommodate sustainable transportation options can help to achieve the FWS mission" [@USFWS2016b].

Of six alternative transportation options listed on the survey, a majority of refuge visitors were likely to use the following at `r paste(params$RefugeName)` in the future (fig. 12):

- `r (altTransTable$Item)[1]` (`r (altTransTable$high)[1]`%)
- `r (altTransTable$Item)[2]` (`r (altTransTable$high)[2]`%)
- `r (altTransTable$Item)[3]` (`r (altTransTable$high)[3]`%)

A majority of visitors indicated they were not likely to use `r (altTransTable$Item)[6]`.
