Dungeness NWR is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Sequim, WA. The refuge was established in 1915 to preserve the unique habitat of the Dungeness Spit, the longest natural sand spit in the United States. The gravel beaches of the spit and the surrounding tide flats, eel beds, and bay provide habitat and nesting ground for a variety of birds and other species. While the refuge is only 773 acres, many different migratory species use the refuge seasonally while others call it home year round. Shorebirds migrate to the refuge in the spring and fall to feed in the highly productive tide flats while waterfowl spend their winters in the calm waters of the Dungeness Bay. Perhaps the most charismatic wildlife to call the refuge home are harbor seals who raise their pups on the isolated tip of the spit. Young salmon and steelhead feed and grow in the eelgrass beds surrounding the spit. In addition, the second oldest lighthouse in the state of Washington still shines bright on the Dungeness Spit. Built in 1857, the lighthouse is a popular hiking destination. The spit continues to grow each year as the sandy bluffs along the Washington coast erode and are deposited along the spit.

Dungeness NWR attracts over 101,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors flock from around the world to hike along this scenic beach. The 10 mile hike out and back to the lighthouse is an exciting challenge for all ages, from eager boyscouts to retirees. Along the beach, visitors can watch bald eagles soar overhead and see flocks of gulls resting along the driftwood. Visiting this refuge is often part of a trip to nearby Olympic National Park and many visitors camp at the neighboring county park. Figure 2 displays a map of Dungeness NWR.
