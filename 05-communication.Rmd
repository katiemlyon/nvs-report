Effective communication with the public is critical for managing and enhancing visitor experiences. Additionally, the Refuge Systemâ€™s success in reaching new and diverse audiences depends on its ability to keep pace with communication trends [@USFWS2016a]. Understanding how visitors both seek out and share information about the refuge and its resources using various communication channels (e.g., printed information, friends and family, websites, social media) can inform the refuge's approach to communicating with visitors at different points of their trips (before, during and after). Information in this section can be used to assess changes in what sources are used as well as how visitors perceive the helpfulness of Service communications over time. Refuge staff can use communication channels preferred by visitors to inform the public about the Refuge System's mission and accomplishments.
