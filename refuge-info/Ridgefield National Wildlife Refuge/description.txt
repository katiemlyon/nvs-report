Ridgefield NWR is located in southwest Washington near the Columbia River, about 25 miles outside of the City of Portland, OR. The refuge was established in 1965 to provide a winter home for the dusky subspecies of the Canada goose. The 5,300 acre refuge is made up of productive wetlands and riparian habitats as well as grasslands and forests. Other migratory waterfowl use the refuge, as well as migratory neo-tropical songbirds. A variety of mammals including deer, river otters, and coyotes also can be seen at Ridgefield NWR. The pools and wetlands of the refuge provide habitat for a variety of amphibians and reptiles such as the chorus frog and painted turtles. In addition, the refuge has a rich human history; the most intact archaeological site on the lower Columbia River provides evidence that native Americans occupied the lands of the refuge for thousands of years. 
Ridgefield NWR attracts 204,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Two of five of the refuge’s units are open to the public. On the River S Unit, visitors can enjoy bird watching from the 4 mile auto tour route or can get a closer look at wildlife from the Kiwa hiking trail. On the Carty Unit, visitors have the unique opportunity to experience a full scale recreation of a Chinookan plankhouse. In the summer, monthly interpretive events in the plankhouse help bring the native American history of this area to life. For more information, please visit https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ridgefield/.
