Big Branch Marsh NWR is located in eastern Louisiana on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain; it is considered an urban refuge as it is only 30 miles outside of the city of New Orleans. The refuge was established in 1994 largely thanks to the efforts of local organizations that recognized how quickly their local wildlife habitat was being lost to urban development. The 18,000 acre refuge is composed of many different habitat types including pine savannah in the northern parts of the refuge and marshes in the southern areas. The pine savannahs provide necessary nesting habitat for the endangered Red Cockaded Woodpecker. The refuge provides additional support to this species by installing nesting boxes in pine trees that mimic their natural nest cavities. The marsh habitats support a variety of fish, shellfish, shorebirds, and migratory waterfowl. The refuge is home to many year round residents ranging from alligators to minks. 
Big Branch Marsh attracts 228,126 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Many visitors enjoy the refuge through consumptive activities: crabbing and fishing are popular activities in the Lake Road area of the refuge. Hunting is also a popular activity on the refuge: visitors have the opportunity to participate in annual waterfowl, deer and small game hunt seasons. Kayaking and hiking provide additional ways for visitors to observe wildlife within the refuge. A visitor’s center offers interpretive exhibits, and the annual Wild Things Festival draws in thousands of visitors to enjoy a variety of environmental education activities.
