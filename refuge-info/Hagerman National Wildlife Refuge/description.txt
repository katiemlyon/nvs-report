Hagerman NWR is located directly north of Dallas and just south of the Texas-Oklahoma border. The refuge encompasses the upper portion of the Big Mineral Arm of Lake Texoma, which is one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. The refuge was established in 1946 with the primary focus of providing a winter home for migratory waterfowl. Refuge lands were originally purchased by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the Denison Dam Project that created Lake Texoma. 
Hagerman NWR is located along the Central Flyway, and hundreds of thousands of birds either reside at the refuge or stay there during part of the year while migrating. Though the birds are the most abundant type of wildlife at the refuge, many other species thrive on the 11,320 acres of protected habitat. Reptiles, amphibians, insects, fish, and mammals, such as deer, turkeys, bobcats, coyotes, and fox squirrels, all call the refuge home. Of the refuge’s total acreage, approximately 8,700 consist of uplands with the remaining 2,600 acres being comprised of wetlands. Each year approximately 190,000 visitors spend time at Hagerman NWR (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.) Visitor activities include bird watching, wildlife observation, photography, fishing, hunting, hiking, and use of the Visitor Center for environmental education, interpretation, and special events. The refuge has a very active Friends group, Friends of Hagerman, which helps to promote the refuge through a number of events and other crucial support work. Figure 1 displays a map of the refuge.
