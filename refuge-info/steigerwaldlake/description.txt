Steigerwald Lake NWR is located in southwest Washington on the Columbia River, about 25 miles outside of the city of Portland, Oregon. The refuge was established in 1987 in response to the construction of the second powerhouse at the Bonneville Dam, an impoundment on the Columbia River. Because this construction project resulted in the loss of lowland habitat around the dam, Steigerwald Lake NWR was established to diminish the impact of this project on wildlife and create new habitat for migratory and resident wildlife. A mosaic of wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands make up the 1,049 acre refuge. The refuge is home to over 200 species of birds, including many birds of prey such as osprey and harriers. Another interesting bird that uses the refuge is the purple martin: the refuge provides nesting gourds for this migratory bird. In addition, the refuge contains a fish ladder to assist migratory fish such as Coho Salmon and steelhead in their journey towards spawning grounds. 
Steigerwald Lake NWR attracts over 124,002 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can enjoy birdwatching and wildlife photography from a number of overlooks on the refuge. A unique opportunity available to visitors is the 2 ¾ mile art trail: this trail features wildlife centric works of art that allow visitors to experience the refuge from a new perspective. The Columbia River Dike Trail passes through a portion of the refuge and offers opportunities for biking, running, and horseback riding. Figure 1 displays a map of Steigerwald Lake NWR.
