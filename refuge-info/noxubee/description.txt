Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee NWR is located in Starkville, MS within three counties (Noxubee, Oktibbeha, and Winston). The refuge was established in 1940 and was created from lands obtained through the 1930s Resettlement Administration. It has 42,500 acres and it is home to alligators, river otters, raccoons, skunks, beavers, opossums, bobcats and foxes. Alligators spend their time mostly in the water habitats with four green-tree reservoirs (GTRs), two major lakes (Bluff Lake – 800 acres and Loakfoma Lake – 400 acres), 16 small impoundments, and assorted wetland areas made by the CCC.  In addition, the refuge has a very unique bottomland hardwood habitat that consists of half of the refuge. This is mainly for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. This population of woodpeckers is one of only four sites the species can be seen in the state of Mississippi. 
Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee NWR attracts over 242,600 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can spend their time enjoying the visitors center, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife photography, wildlife observation, environmental education, research, or hiking the boardwalks and trails for a scenic sunset. Some visitors choose to relax in the peace and quiet on benches or with their hammocks. Figure 1 displays a map of Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee NWR.
