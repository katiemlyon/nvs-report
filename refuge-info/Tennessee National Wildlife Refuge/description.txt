Tennessee NWR is located in northwestern Tennessee on the southern end of Kentucky Lake. The refuge was established in 1945 for the protection of migratory birds. The refuge’s 51,000 acres are split into three units: Busseltown, Duck River Bottoms, and Big Sandy. These units are spread along 65 miles of the Tennessee River as it becomes Kentucky Lake. The habitats within the refuge include open water, agricultural crops, vegetated wetlands, mudflats, shrub/scrub areas and forest lands. These habitats, particularly the agricultural fields and wetlands, provide a winter home to large numbers of waterfowl. The refuge provides habitat for a wide diversity of other birds: three quarters of all the bird species present in Tennessee have been recorded on the refuge. In addition, the refuge is home to many mammals, fish, and reptiles. Whitetail deer and other small mammals such as raccoons and rabbits are common.
Tennessee NWR attracts over 410,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors have a variety of recreational opportunities available to them on the refuge. Multiple boat launches provide opportunities for motorized and non-motorized boating on the refuge. Fishing is permitted on the refuge as is hunting for deer, turkey and other small game. Visitors can observe wildlife and take photos from one of the hiking trails or observation towers. The refuge also has a large visitor center that offers interpretive exhibits and programs.
