Loess Bluffs NWR is located in northwestern Missouri about 90 miles north of Kansas City, MO. The refuge was established in 1935 to provide feeding and breeding grounds for migratory birds and other wildlife. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) constructed many of the trails, road, dikes, and buildings in 1935-36. The 7,440 acre refuge is home to many species of migrating birds, ducks, deer, coyotes, and many other smaller mammals. As many as 300 immature and adult bald eagles may be seen during peak migration. There was a record 476 bald eagles counted in a 2001 survey. According to the National Audubon Society, Loess Bluffs NWR is one of America’s Top 500 Globally Important Birding areas. The refuge is named after the 30 million year old geological formations of fine silt that have been blown into steep hills. These loess soil mounds contain rich material for agriculture.
Loess Bluffs NWR attracts over 85,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). At the welcome center, visitors can learn about the history of the refuge and the wildlife that use it by watching a short film. A network of hiking trails starts at the visitors center where visitors can experience the unique habitat. The main attraction for visitors is the 13 mile auto tour loop that surrounds the outer edge of the refuge wetlands. While driving this loop visitors can enjoy birding, wildlife photography, and wildlife observation. Bald eagles, mallards, pelicans, and thousands of snow geese can be seen throughout various seasons on the refuge. There are convenient observation spots scattered throughout the loop to allow visitors to step out and experience the refuge with all their senses. Figure 1 displays a map of Loess Bluffs NWR.
