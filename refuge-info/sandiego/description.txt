San Diego NWR is located in southern California. The refuge was established in 1996 for the protection of endangered and threatened species of wildlife. The refuge is located within close proximity to the city of San Diego and thus provides environmental educational opportunities for many of the city’s inhabitants. The 11,152 acre refuge is composed of six habitat types: coastal sage scrub, chaparral, grassland, riparian forest, and oak woodlands and vernal pools. The refuge is mountainous, with the San Miguel and McGinty Mountains providing variable topography. The refuge is home to at least three endangered species of animals including two birds, the California gnatcatcher and the Least Bell’s Vireo, and the Quino Checkerspot butterfly. In addition, the refuge contains three endangered plant species. Much of the land within the refuge was formerly agricultural and the habitats are being actively restored to maximize the benefit to wildlife. 
San Diego NWR attracts over 32,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Three hiking trails of varying difficulties provide visitors with a variety of ways to experience the refuge. In addition to hiking, the trails are open to bike riding and horseback riding. The trail system is the best way for visitors to observe wildlife and birdwatching and wildlife photography are common activities. Figure 1 displays a map of San Diego NWR.
