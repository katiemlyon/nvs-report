Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually NWR is located in Northwestern Washington on the southern shore of the Puget Sound. The refuge was established in 1974 to protect the Nisqually River Delta and the fish and other wildlife that depend on the delta habitat. This is significant because the majority of delta habitats in the region have been dramatically altered through dredging and development. The Nisqually Delta is a particularly productive environment; the area where the freshwaters of the Nisqually River mix with the Puget Sound a nutrient rich estuary is created. This estuary provides habitat for a variety of sea life: the area is particularly important for young salmon such as the endangered Coho salmon. In 2009, the largest estuary restoration project in the Pacific Northwest occured in this refuge and the project is expected to benefit both wildlife and the people that depend on them. In addition to many fish species, the refuge is home to a variety of wading birds, aquatic mammals, turtles and frogs. 
Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually NWR attracts over 201,824 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Located right off of interstate 5 between the cities of Tacoma and Olympia, this urban refuge is easily accessible to a large population of visitors. Visitors can enjoy walking, observing wildlife, and taking photographs from the multiple boardwalk trails on the refuge. One of the long boardwalk trails takes visitors far out into the tidal flats of the estuary and visitors can always see something new depending on the height of the tide during their visit. The refuge also has a visitors center and education center when families and school groups can participate in environmental education programs. Figure 1 displays a map of Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually.
