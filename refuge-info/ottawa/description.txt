Ottawa NWR is located in northwest Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie. The refuge was established in 1961 to provide habitat for migratory birds as well as resident endangered and threatened species. The refuge represents a small fragment of what was once a vast wetland area called the Great Black Swamp. The 6,500 acre refuge is composed of multiple habitat types including wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands. It is home to a wide variety of bird species. Bald eagles are common on the refuge and many nesting pairs raise their young in the area. During spring migration, 38 species of warblers find a seasonal home on the refuge. A common shorebird that uses the refuge is the dunlin; flocks of over 2,000 of these birds have been seen in the refuge mudflats during peak migration. The refuge is able to provide habitat for a wide diversity of birds by manipulating water levels in wetlands based on the needs of the birds that are migrating through. 
Ottawa NWR attracts over 333,706 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can enjoy a variety of wildlife observation opportunities from the hiking trails and auto tour route on the refuge. Photography and birdwatching are also popular activities. Hunting and fishing opportunities are also available on the refuge. Hunters can hunt whitetail deer, waterfowl, small game, upland birds, and turkey during specific seasons. A visitor center on the refuge provides opportunities for interpretation and environmental education. Figure 1 displays a map of Ottawa NWR.
