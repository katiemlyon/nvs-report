Pinckney Island NWR is located on the southern coast of South Carolina. The refuge has been a home for wildlife since 1935 as it was previously managed as a private game preserve. The refuge was established in 1975 when the previous owners donated the land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The 4,053 acre refuge is composed of multiple islands and the dominant habitat type is salt marsh. The refuge islands also contain forests, brushlands, fallow fields, and freshwater ponds. The refuge provides seasonal homes to migratory birds along their journey on the Atlantic Flyway including the colorful painted bunting. The refuge also provides nesting habitat for wading birds such as the white ibis. The refuge is one of the best locations to see another unique wading bird, the yellow-crowned night heron. American Alligators are another charismatic species that is frequently seen on the refuge. 
Pinckney Island NWR attracts over 226,922 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). While the refuge encompasses multiple islands, only the largest of these, Pinckney Island, is open to the public. Here, visitors can enjoy hiking and biking on the refuge’s trail system. A boat ramp on the refuge allows visitors to explore the waters of the refuge via motor boats or kayaks. Birdwatching and wildlife photography are also popular activities on the refuge. Saltwater fishing is permitted on the refuge year round and a one-day whitetail deer hunt is held annually in November. Figure 1 displays a map of Pinckney Island NWR.
