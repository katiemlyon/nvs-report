Sachuest Point NWR is located on an Aquidneck island in southeastern Rhode Island. The island is located in Narragansett Bay. The refuge land has historically hosted a variety of uses including farming in past centuries and a U.S. Navy range during World War II. The refuge was established in 1970 when the Audubon Society of Rhode Island donated 70 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge has since grown to 242 acres through additional land transfers from the Navy. Though the refuge is small, it provides important habitat for a variety of wildlife. The refuge is composed of three main habitat types: shrubland, cobble beach, and salt marsh. The shrubland provides a much needed home for the New England cottontail rabbit. Over two hundred species of birds use the refuge, including migratory waterfowl such as the uniquely colored harlequin duck.  The cobble beaches on the refuge’s shore provide feeding and nesting habitat for shorebirds such as the threatened piping plover. In addition, the refuge contains interesting geologic formations: some of the rocks near the Price Neck overlook used to be part of the African continent before Pangea broke apart. 
Sachuest Point NWR attracts over 331,065 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). One of the most popular activities on the refuge is saltwater fishing. Visitors can enjoy birdwatching and wildlife photography from one of the refuge’s observation towers. Three miles of hiking trails provide unique recreational opportunities. A visitor center provides interpretive displays for visitors and offers environmental education programs. Figure 1 displays a map of Sachuest Point NWR.
