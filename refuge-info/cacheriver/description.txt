Cache River NWR is located in northeast Arkansas. The refuge was established in 1986 to protect wetland habitats and provide resting and feeding areas for migratory waterfowl. The refuge is over 72,000 acres in size and is spread out in non-continuous tracts throughout the Cache River Basin. The refuge is located in the lower Mississippi River Valley, a region that has undergone dramatic hydrologic alteration resulting in the widespread loss of wetlands. The refuge represents a fragment of this region that was not disturbed and thus contains tracts of intact bottomland hardwood forest. This seasonally flooded habitat is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including many migratory waterfowl and songbird species. The refuge also contains moist soil units, which are impounded wetlands that are actively managed by refuge staff to provide ideal habitat for migratory birds. Cooperative farming in these units allows farmers to harvest crops from the refuge while leaving a portion of the harvest in the field to feed wildlife.
Cache River NWR attracts over 187,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). The dominant public uses of Cache River NWR revolve around hunting and fishing. The refuge is a notable destination for waterfowl and deer hunting. Commercial and recreational fishing occur on the refuge and an annual youth fishing derby occurs each summer. In addition to these consumptive uses, visitors can also enjoy wildlife observation and photography on the refuge. Visitors can also canoe on the Bayou DeView water trail.
