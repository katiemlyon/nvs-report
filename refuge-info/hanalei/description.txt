Hanalei NWR is located on the north side of the Island of Kauai in Hawaii. The refuge was established in 1972 under the Endangered Species Act to preserve habitat for five endangered waterbirds: the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck), the ‘alae ke‘oke‘o (Hawaiian coot), the ‘alae‘ula (Hawaiian moorhen), the ae‘o (Hawaiian stilt), and the nēnē (Hawaiian goose). The refuge is also home to 45 other species of birds including migratory shorebirds such as the Pacific piping plover. The 917 acre refuge is characterized by mostly flat areas within the Hanalei River Valley. The refuge is surrounded by steep, lush mountains. Refuge staff manage water control structures within the refuge that divert the Hanalei River to create impoundments, crop fields, and wet pastures that provide food and shelter for wildlife. 
Hanalei NWR attracts over 402,782 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). While the refuge is closed to public access to protect to minimize disturbance to wildlife; visitors can get a glimpse of the refuge from an observation deck along the Kuhio Highway. Interpretive panels at this observation point allow visitors to learn about the history and purpose of the refuge. Additionally, visitors can kayak along the Hanalei River through the refuge although they must launch their boats from outside of the refuge. A state managed hiking trail, the Okolehao trail, is accessible within the refuge. Figure 1 displays a map of Hanalei NWR. For more information, please visit https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hanalei.
