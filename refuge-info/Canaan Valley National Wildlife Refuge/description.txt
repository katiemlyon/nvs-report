Canaan Valley NWR is located in northeastern West Virginia. The refuge was established in 1994 with the purchase of just 86 acres; the refuge has since grown to 16,550 acres. The refuge protects a unique high elevation wetland complex, the largest of its type in the southern Appalachian mountains. This wetland complex is composed of many wetland types including muskeg, alder, wet meadow, swamp forest and spiraea thicket. During the last ice age, many northern plant species were pushed southward by glaciation and eventually took hold in Canaan Valley. Today, this unique habitat hosts plant communities more commonly found at much higher latitudes and the refuge is sometimes described as “a little piece of Canada gone astray”. The wetland complex is home to a variety of mammals such as beavers and mink as well as ducks, wading birds and shorebirds. The slopes surrounding the valley are covered in trees that are typical to a boreal forest community; these forests are home to species such as the threatened Cheat mountain salamander and the endangered Indiana bat. 
Canaan Valley NWR attracts over 59,776 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can hike the trail system at the refuge while enjoying birdwatching and wildlife photography. A visitor center is available on the refuge and provides environmental interpretation and education programs. In the wintertime, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are popular activities. Hunting opportunities on the refuge are plentiful and include seasons for deer, black bear, small game, coyotes, bobcats, and a variety of birds. Figure 1 displays a map of Canaan Valley.
