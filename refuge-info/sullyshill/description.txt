Sullys Hill National Game Preserve is located in northeast North Dakota on the southern shore of Devil’s Lake. Originally established as a national park by Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Sullys Hill was later designated as a big game preserve in 1914 and finally transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1931. The 1,674 acres of the preserve include both prairie habitat and forested hills. The game preserve is managed for bison and elk as well as other wildlife and migratory birds. Because bison and elk were eliminated from this part of their historic range, individuals had to be reintroduced into the preserve in 1917. The preserve is now home to small herds of 20 bison and 18 elk. Another charismatic species that calls the preserve home is the black tailed prairie dog; these small mammals were reintroduced to the preserve in 1975 and live in “towns” consisting of elaborate systems of tunnels. 
Sully’s Hill NWR attracts over 67,178 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors enjoy birdwatching and wildlife photography from the 4-mile wildlife drive. Two miles of hiking trails provide additional opportunities for visitors to see a wide diversity of bird species depending on the season.
