John Heinz NWR at Tinicum is located in southeastern Pennsylvania within the city limits of Philadelphia. This area is the last remnant of a large tidal marsh that was historically lost to farming and development; the Tinicum Marsh was almost lost entirely when Interstate-95 was constructed. Local citizens worked together to save the marsh and set the stage for the creation of a wildlife refuge. The refuge was established in 1972 as the first urban refuge in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The primary purpose for the refuge’s establishment was to preserve and restore the Tinicum Marsh, the largest remaining freshwater tidal marsh in Pennsylvania. Located along the Atlantic Flyway, the refuge provides shelter for many migratory birds along their journey. This includes shorebirds, wading birds, and wintering waterfowl. In addition, the refuge supports a variety of mammals from shrews and voles to bats and deer. Notably, the refuge provides the last possible habitat in the state of Pennsylvania for the marsh rice rat. 
John Heinz NWR at Tinicum attracts over 250,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). There are a variety of ways that that visitors can observe the wildlife that call the refuge home. Kayakers can paddle 4.5 miles of Darby Creek in the refuge. 10 miles of trails and multiple observation platforms provide ample opportunities for birdwatching and wildlife photography.
