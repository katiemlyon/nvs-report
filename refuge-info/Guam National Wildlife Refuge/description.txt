Guam NWR is located on the northern tip of the island of Guam, an unincorporated U.S. Territory situated in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 3,800 miles west of Honolulu and 1,500 miles south of Tokyo. The refuge was established in 1993, in response to the 1984 listing of six species as endangered, and was designated critical habitat in 2004 for three of these species: the Mariana fruit bat, the Guam Micronesian Kingfisher, and the Mariana crow. The Ritidian Unit is located on the northern tip of Guam and hosts a unique and fragile blend of native plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. The refuge encompasses 1,217 acres, including 385 terrestrial acres and 832 acres of submerged areas offshore. 
Guam NWR attracts over 140,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Ritidian is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, offering over a mile of sandy beach where the public may picnic, swim, snorkel, and fish. Visitors can also explore roughly two miles of trails or tour the newly rediscovered ancient village or the numerous caves found along the majestic limestone cliffs.
