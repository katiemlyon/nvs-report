Crab Orchard NWR is located in Southern Illinois near the town of Marion, IL. The refuge was established in 1947 to provide habitat for wildlife under the condition that the land was still used in a way that generated jobs for local people. Prior to refuge establishment, extensive industry associated with World War II occurred in the area. There are still military related manufacturing plants located on the refuge. Soybeans and corn are farmed on refuge lands as well. The 43,890 acres of the refuge are composed of three main habitat types: oak-hickory forests, crop land, and open water. Three large reservoirs, Crab Orchard Lake, Devil’s Kitchen Lake and Little Grassy Lake, provide open water habitat for a variety of warm-water sport fish species as well as waterfowl. Oak-hickory forests cover 56% of refuge land providing habitat for deer, squirrels, rabbit, raccoon, owls, and various migrating species. Bobcats, bald eagles, and wild turkeys can be seen frequenting the refuge in various habitats.
Crab Orchard NWR attracts over 872,661 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Popular activities for visitors include hiking, fishing, and boating. Crab Orchard Lake hosts fishing tournaments and local high school bass fishing teams use the lake for practices. In addition to fishing, the refuge offers a variety of hunting opportunities including big game, upland game, furbearers, waterfowl and migratory birds. A unique recreational opportunity available on the refuge for visitors is camping: two popular campgrounds allow visitors to enjoy overnight sounds and experiences on the wildlife refuge. At the visitor center and the Pigeon Creek Environmental Education Complex, visitors can enjoy environmental education and interpretation. Figure 1 displays a map of Crab Orchard NWR.
