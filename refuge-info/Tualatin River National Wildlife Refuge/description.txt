Tualatin River NWR is located in northwestern Oregon, less than 30 minutes outside of the city of Portland, OR. Tualatin River NWR refuge was established in 1992 through a grassroots effort in the local community. The first 12 acres of the refuge were donated by a local couple who recognized how quickly the open spaces in their community were being commercially developed. The public continues to be  heavily involved in the restoration efforts at Tualatin NWR. Prior to establishment the area was agricultural with cattle and onion farms. The 1,856 acre refuge is split into five units, all of which are in the Tualatin River watershed. Though the refuge makes up a very small portion of this watershed, it provides habitat to a large majority of the area’s wildlife because the area is mostly urban. Located along the Pacific Flyway, the refuge provides winter habitat for migratory waterfowl. The refuge is home to other birds of all sizes, from large hawks to tiny hummingbirds. In addition, the refuge provides habitat for a variety of mammals, amphibians, and reptiles; for example, early morning visitors could expect to see deer, coyotes and foxes along the trails. 
Tualatin River NWR attracts over 149,954 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Only one unit of the refuge is open to the public, but visitors still have a variety of recreational opportunities. Four miles of trails invite visitors to observe wildlife and bird watch along the Tualatin River and in refuge wetlands. A visitor’s center offers environmental education opportunities as well as a number of interpretive programs for children and their families. Figure 1 displays a map of Tualatin River NWR.
