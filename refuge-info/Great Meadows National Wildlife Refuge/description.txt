Great Meadows NWR is located along the Concord and Sudbury Rivers near Boston, Massachusetts. The refuge was established in 1944 when a hunter named Samuel Hoar donated 250 acres of marshland to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since then, the Service has purchased additional lands to grow the refuge to its current size of 3,800 acres split between two units. The main purpose of these wetlands is to provide resting, nesting and feeding habitat to migratory birds. The migratory birds that take advantage of these wetlands include mallards, black ducks, wood ducks and blue winged teal. The refuge is also home to the largest populations of Blanding’s turtles, a state threatened species in Massachusetts. Other species that depend on the wetland habitats, such as blue herons and muskrats, are also common on the refuge. 
Great Meadows NWR attracts over 440,555 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). The wetlands of the refuge have been important hunting and fishing areas for centuries and visitors continue to enjoy the bountiful wildlife provided by the refuge: deer and waterfowl hunting are popular throughout the fall and winter. Birdwatching is also a popular activity on the refuge. Multiple trails on the refuge provide opportunities for visitors to observe wildlife while they hike in the summer and snowshoe in the winter.
