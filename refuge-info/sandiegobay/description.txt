San Diego Bay NWR is located on the coast of Southern California. In 1988 the first unit of the refuge was established, the 316 acre Sweetwater marsh. The refuge dramatically grew in 1999 when the 2,300 acre South San Diego Bay unit was added to the refuge. The refuge is composed of open water in San Diego Bay, salt marshes, and mud flats. These remnants of coastal habitat provide the last areas of wildlife habitat in a highly developed and urbanized area. Located on the Pacific Flyway, the refuge provides breeding and feeding grounds to numerous migratory bird species. The refuge provides habitat for numerous endangered species including the endangered clapper rail. Captive breeding programs have been very successful in increasing the number of clapper rails that call the refuge home. In addition, the refuge provides habitat for numerous invertebrates and juvenile fish. 
San Diego Bay NWR attracts over 94,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can see native wildlife up close inside the Discovery Center aquarium and aviary. Visitors can also see birds and other wildlife in their natural environment from the refuge’s hiking trails. Bike riding is also a popular activity on the refuge. Fishing is allowed in certain areas, and environmental education is a common use. The close proximity of the refuge to a large urban center allows easy access for many school groups. Figure 1 displays a map of San Diego Bay NWR.
