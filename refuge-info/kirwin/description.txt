Kirwin NWR is located in northern-central Kansas. The refuge was established in 1954 for the purpose of conserving and managing habitat for migratory waterfowl. The 10,778 acre refuge is made up of rolling hills in the valley of the North Fork of the Solomon River. The this portion of the river is impounded at Kirwin Dam and the resulting Kirwin Reservoir is located entirely within the refuge. The main habitats in the refuge include open water, wetlands, grasslands, and wooded riparian areas. The croplands that surround the refuge and the large expanses of open water on the Kirwin Reservoir attract large flocks of waterfowl including Canada geese and snow geese as well as a variety of ducks. In addition, the refuge is home to many native prairie species such as whitetail deer, upland birds such as the greater prairie chicken and ring necked pheasant, and prairie dogs. 
Kirwin NWR attracts over 90,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Fishing and hunting are two of the most popular activities on the refuge. Multiple boat launches and recreation areas allow visitors to fish from boats as well as the shore. The large bucks that thrive on the refuge draw in visitors from all over the country for the annual archery deer hunt. Two nature trails are available to visitors, including one that winds through an active prairie dog town and gives a close look at the lives of these charismatic little mammals.
