Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee NWR is located in southeastern Florida, about 30 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. The levy that surrounds the refuge was built by the Army Corps in the 1940s and the resulting water storage area was put under management by the South Florida Water Management District, a Florida state agency. In 1951, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service entered a license agreement with the South Florida Water Management District that established the refuge. The 145,189 acre refuge protects one of the last remnants of northern Everglades habitat. This wetland habitat is a mosaic of a mosaic of wet prairies, sawgrass ridges, sloughs, tree islands, cattail communities, and the largest intact cypress swamp remaining in southeastern Florida. The refuge is home to more than 250 species of birds, including the endangered snail kite and threatened wood stork. In addition, the refuge provides vast habitat for american alligators as well as many other reptiles.
