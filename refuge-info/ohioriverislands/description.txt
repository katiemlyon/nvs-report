Ohio River Islands NWR is a set of islands and mainland tracts located along the Ohio River, as far north as Pittsburgh and as far south as Kentucky. The refuge was established in 1990 to preserve and restore the islands and floodplain of the Ohio River and the wildlife native to that habitat. The refuge’s 3,440 acres of land are split up between twenty-two islands and four mainland tracts, primarily in West Virginia. The riparian areas in the refuge provide habitat to a wide diversity of migratory birds; one of the most exciting sights on the refuge is to watch an osprey swoop down and catch one of the plentiful fish from the Ohio River. The productive riparian forests of the refuge provide habitat for a variety of frogs, turtles, and more than 25 species of mammals. Although they are rarely seen, the refuge’s underwater habitats are home to a huge diversity of freshwater mussels: 47 native species of these important filter feeders reside within refuge waters, including 8 federally endangered species. 
Ohio River Islands NWR attracts 94,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Boating and fishing are popular activities in refuge waters, particularly in the warm summer months. Hunting is allowed on most of the refuge’s islands. Visitors enjoy hiking and wildlife observation on the refuge’s trails, including 3 miles of trails on Middle Island. Visitors can also enjoy free interpretive programs at the Visitor Center located in Williamstown, West Virginia. Figure 1 displays a map of Ohio River Islands NWR.
