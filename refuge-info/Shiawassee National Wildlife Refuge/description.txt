Shiawassee NWR is located in the central lower peninsula of Michigan. The area surrounding the refuge is referred to as the Shiawassee Flats: this wetland habitat was formed over 10,000 years ago when a vast glacial lake covered the region. The lands of the refuge have a varied history dating back thousands of years; most recently, the area was drained and used for agriculture. The refuge was established in 1953 to restore the natural wetlands and enhance migratory bird habitat. Cooperative farming continues on the refuge as a management technique to feed the thousands of ducks and geese that use the refuge during their spring and fall migrations. In addition to waterfowl, shorebird, raptors and more than 100 species of songbirds utilize the refuge. A notable songbird that nests on the refuge is the prothonotary warbler: this bird is the only warbler that nests in tree cavities in the eastern United States. In addition to the widespread forested wetlands, the refuge is actively restoring its lake-plain prairie habitat, a globally imperiled ecosystem.
Shiawassee NWR attracts over 67,639 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). As one of the largest and most productive wetlands in Michigan, the refuge offers ample opportunities for hunting and fishing. Annual goose and whitetail deer hunts draw in many visitors. Two trail systems allow visitors to explore miles of the refuge and see wildlife in their natural habitat. Visitors can also enjoy birdwatching and wildlife photography from the 6.5 mile auto tour route. Figure 1 displays a map of Shiawassee NWR.
