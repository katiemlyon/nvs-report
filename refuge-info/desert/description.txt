Desert NWR is located in southern Nevada just 30 miles outside of Las Vegas, NV. The refuge was established in 1936 for the protection of desert bighorn sheep. The refuge is the largest in the National Wildlife Refuge System in the lower 48 states at 1.6 million acres. The refuge is located in a transition zone between the Mojave Desert and the Great Basin and encompasses six mountain ranges. The plant communities of the refuge vary with changes in elevation, with bristlecone pine trees dominating at the highest elevations and a salt brush community thriving at the lowest elevations. With this wide range of habitat types, the refuge can support a wide diversity of wildlife despite the arid climate. In addition to big horn sheep, the refuge is home to over 320 bird species, 52 mammal species, and 35 reptile species. The endangered desert tortoise is among the reptiles that call the refuge home. 
Desert NWR attracts over 48,012 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.).  In the Corn Creek area, visitors can enjoy interpretive displays at the visitors center or hike one of the trails. Multiple roadways cross the refuge and offer additional opportunities for wildlife observation and photography. Camping is allowed in the refuge both at the primitive Desert Pass campground and in the backcountry. A limited number of permits are available each year to hunt bighorn sheep. The western portion of the refuge is not open to the public as it is used as an Air Force test and training range. Figure 1 displays a map of Desert NWR.
