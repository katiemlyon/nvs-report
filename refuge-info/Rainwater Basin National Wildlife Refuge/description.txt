Rainwater Basin Wetland Management District (WMD) is located southeastern Nebraska. The area is a complex of wetlands scattered throughout a 21-county area. The refuge was established in 1963 when the Fish and Wildlife Service began acquiring critical migratory waterfowl habitat in southeastern Nebraska. Today, 61 individual Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs) have been purchased, most of them with Duck Stamp dollars. Historically, bison and wildfire kept the wetlands open with annual plants growing during dry summer months and droughts. With bison gone and wildfires controlled, management has to be done to keep these wetlands in a condition favored by ducks, geese, and other water birds.
Rainwater consists of wetlands and uplands. Wetlands provide essential food sources for migrating waterfowl such as mallards, pintails, and geese; and shorebirds such as plovers, sandpipers, and avocets. Upland habitats in the district provide vital food sources and shelter year round for upland birds such as pheasants, quail, and prairie chickens. Mammals such as white-tailed deer and black tailed prairie dogs also utilize these plains oases. 
Rainwater Basin attracts over 85,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors can do many activities including hunting, wildlife observation, environmental education/interpretation, and photography. Figure 1 displays a map of Rainwater Basin WMD.
