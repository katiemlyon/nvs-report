Okefenokee NWR is located in southeast Georgia. The refuge was established by executive order in 1936 to provide habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. The refuge is the largest in the eastern U.S. at 402,000 acres. The refuge covers almost all of the Okefenokee Swamp, a 7,000 year old rain fed wetland that forms the headwaters of the Suwannee and St. Marys Rivers. 353,981 acres of the refuge are designated as a National Wilderness Area. The name Okefenokee means “Land of the Trembling Earth” in Choctaw and is descriptive of the vast peat deposits that make up the swamp. Though the refuge has changed dramatically throughout human history, largely through logging, it remains one of the largest intact freshwater ecosystems in the world. It is home to many charismatic species including alligators, black bears, gopher tortoises, and sandhill cranes. The pine forest surrounding the swamp provides habitat for the endangered red cockaded woodpecker. 
Okefenokee NWR attracts over 646,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Boating is one of the most popular ways for visitors to experience the refuge. Guided boat tours take visitors out into the swamp and provide interpretive information about the swamp and its wildlife. Visitors can also explore the refuge in their own canoes via miles of water trails and backcountry floating camping platforms. A unique partnership with Georgia State Parks allows visitors to have access to a full hookup campground as well as cabins within the refuge. Hiking trails and an auto tour route provide additional opportunities for wildlife observation and photography. The restored Chesser Island Homestead provides visitors with a glimpse into the human history of the refuge. Figure 1 displays a map of Okefenokee NWR.
