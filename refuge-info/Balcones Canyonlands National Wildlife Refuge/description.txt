Balcones Canyonlands NWR is located in central Texas, about 50 miles northwest of Austin. The refuge was established in 1992 to preserve unique nesting habitat that is critical for two songbirds: the black-capped vireo and the endangered golden-cheeked warbler. Up until recently, the black-capped vireo was listed as endangered; however, thanks to protections such as those at Balcones Canyonlands NWR the bird was delisted. The refuge features a mosaic of habitats ranging from old growth stands of Ashe Juniper trees and oak shrubs to limestone hills and spring-fed canyons along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. The name “Balcones” comes from the Spanish word for balconies and is representative of the natural limestone terraces that visitors can expect to see on the refuge. The 27,500 acres of the refuge feature an astounding diversity of plants: over 700 species have been identified on the refuge so far. In addition to the two endangered songbirds, more than 200 other species of birds use the refuge; painted buntings and peregrine falcons are some of the most exciting birds to see. 
Balcones Canyonlands NWR attracts over 96,553 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Birdwatching is a popular activity on the refuge, particularly in the spring and summer when the endangered golden-cheeked warbler and black-capped vireo can be spotted. Multiple hiking trails are available for visitors to get a closer look at the scenery and the wildlife that thrives on the refuge. The refuge also offers multiple hunting opportunities: in the fall, visitors can hunt doves, whitetail deer, and feral hogs. Figure 1 displays a map of Balcones Canyonlands NWR.
