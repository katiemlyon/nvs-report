Kilauea Point NWR is located on the northern shore of the island of Kauai in Hawaii. Prior to refuge establishment, the area was owned by the U.S. Coast Guard and was transferred the to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service when the lighthouse was decommissioned. The refuge was established in 1985 to protect nesting seabird colonies. Another purpose of the refuge is to provide habitat for endangered species such as the nēnē (Hawaiian goose) and ‘a‘o (Newell’s shearwater). The refuge is home to a wide diversity of birds including the Laysan albatross, red-footed boobies, red- and white-tailed tropicbirds, great frigatebirds, wedge-tailed shearwaters and Pacific golden plovers. The 199 acre refuge is characterized by dramatic, steep cliffs that drop into the Pacific Ocean. A number of marine mammals and reptiles can be seen in the waters below the refuge including spinner dolphins humpback whales, and green turtles. In addition, the Daniel K. Inouye Kīlauea Point Lighthouse is located on the refuge; this lighthouse was built in 1913 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
