["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 The National Wildlife Refuge System 1.2 Why a survey of refuge visitors?", " 1 Introduction The National Wildlife Refuge System plays a unique role in connecting current and future generations to our nation’s rich natural heritage. A national wildlife refuge visit can instill a lasting passion for wildlife and wild lands. A carefully designed set of amenities, services, and recreational opportunities contributes to and enhances the visitor experience, making these important connections possible. Opportunities for outdoor recreation draw millions of people each year to national wildlife refuges. Many visitors enjoy hiking, paddling, wildlife viewing or nature photography. Others take part in heritage sports such as hunting and fishing. All these activities offer visitors a chance to unplug from the stresses of modern life and reconnect with their natural surroundings. 1.1 The National Wildlife Refuge System Established in 1903, and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), The National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) is the leading network of protected lands and waters in the world specifically dedicated to the conservation of fish, wildlife, and their habitats. With 55 million visits per year, the Refuge System is committed to maintaining customer satisfaction and public engagement and strives to be the best place for people and wildlife to thrive (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Census Bureau 2018). As stated in the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1997, the mission of the Refuge System is “to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management and, where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.” Part of achieving this mission is the goal “to foster understanding and instill appreciation of the diversity and interconnectedness of fish, wildlife, and plants, and their habitats” and “to provide and enhance opportunities to participate in compatible wildlife-dependent recreation.” There are 567 national wildlife refuges (refuges) and 38 wetland management districts nationwide, including possessions and territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, encompassing 95 million acres of land (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Census Bureau 2018). (QUESTION: Do we add marine national monuments and submerged lands and waters?) There is at least one refuge in every state and territory and within an hour’s drive of most major cities. This accessibility makes it easy for communities to enjoy their wildlife heritage. The Refuge System attracts more than 55 million visitors annually, including 39.6 million people who observe and photograph birds and wildlife, 9.7 million who hunt and fish, and 2.6 million teachers and students who use refuges as outdoor classrooms. 1.2 Why a survey of refuge visitors? Understanding visitor perceptions of refuges and characterizing their experiences on refuges are critical elements of managing refuges and meeting the goals of the Refuge System. The President’s Management Agenda identifies the National Wildlife Refuge System as a high-impact service provider. Refuges work to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction by operating visitor centers; designing, installing and maintaining accessible trails; constructing viewing blinds; issuing special use permits; contracting with private concessions, and leveraging low recreation fees for facility improvements. Understanding changing visitor trends requires the same commitment to robust inventory and monitoring that the Refuge System has so diligently applied throughout its history. The national visitor survey effort provides managers, planners, visitor services specialists, and others with reliable baseline data. Knowing who visits refuges and what they do, how satisfied they are with their experience, and what their economic contributions are to the local community help refuge staff communicate the value of the refuge, set priorities, plan better, and track trends over time. The purpose of the overall effort is to better understand visitor experiences and trip characteristics on refuges across Refuge System, to gauge visitors levels of satisfaction with existing recreational opportunities, and to garner feedback from visitors about their trips to inform the design of programs and facilities. The survey results are intended to inform performance, planning, budget, and communications goals. Results will also inform Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs), visitor services, and transportation planning processes. Baseline information is also fundamental to the Service’s Inventory and Monitoring Initiative, and can be used to assess changes over time (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2017). Systematic monitoring of national wildlife refuges with 50,000 or more visitors per year will occur on a 5-year rotating basis (approx. 36 refuges/year). Visitors are contacted onsite, and the survey is administered by mail (with web option) once visitors return home. The national visitor survey is a collaborative effort between the Service, The Ohio State University (OSU), and American Conservation Experience (ACE). References "],
["refuge-description.html", "2 Refuge Description", " 2 Refuge Description Dungeness NWR is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Sequim, WA. The refuge was established in 1915 to preserve the unique habitat of the Dungeness Spit, the longest natural sand spit in the United States. The gravel beaches of the spit and the surrounding tide flats, eel beds, and bay provide habitat and nesting ground for a variety of birds and other species. While the refuge is only 773 acres, many different migratory species use the refuge seasonally while others call it home year round. Shorebirds migrate to the refuge in the spring and fall to feed in the highly productive tide flats and waterfowl spend their winters in the calm waters of the Dungeness Bay. Perhaps the most charismatic wildlife to call the refuge home are harbor seals who raise their pups on the isolated tip of the spit. Young salmon and steelhead feed and grow in the eelgrass beds surrounding the spit. In addition, the second oldest lighthouse in the state of Washington still shines bright on the refuge. Built in 1857, the lighthouse is a popular hiking destination. The spit continues to grow each year as the sandy bluffs along the Washington coast erode and are deposited along the spit. Dungeness NWR attracts over 101,000 visitors annually (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018, written comm.). Visitors flock from around the world to hike along this scenic beach. The 10 mile hike out and back to the lighthouse is an exciting challenge for all ages, from eager Boy Scouts to retirees. Along the beach, visitors can watch bald eagles soar overhead and see flocks of gulls resting along the driftwood. Visiting this refuge is often part of a trip to nearby Olympic National Park and many visitors camp at the neighboring county park. Figure 2.1 displays a map of Dungeness NWR.

["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Contacting Visitors 3.2 Sampling at This Refuge 3.3 Interpreting the Results", " 3 Methods 3.1 Contacting Visitors Refuge staff identified two separate 14-day sampling periods, and one or more locations at which to sample, that best reflected the diversity of use and specific visitation patterns of each participating refuge. A standardized sampling schedule was created for all refuges that included eight randomly selected sampling shifts during each of the two sampling periods. Sampling shifts were four hour time bands, stratified across AM and PM as well as weekend and weekdays. In coordination with refuge staff, any necessary customizations were made to the standardized schedule to accommodate the identified sampling locations and to address specific spatial and temporal patterns of visitation. Twenty-five visitors (18 years of age or older) per sampling shift were systematically selected, for a total of 375 willing participants per refuge (or 200 per sampling period) to ensure an adequate sample of completed surveys. When necessary, shifts were moved, added, or extended to overcome logistical limitations (for example, weather or low visitation at a particular site) in an effort to reach target numbers. American Conservation Experience (ACE) interns and/or USFWS Human Dimensions staff (survey recruiters) contacted visitors onsite following a protocol provided by OSU that was designed to obtain a representative sample. Instructions included contacting visitors across the entire sampling shift (for example, every nth visitor for dense visitation, as often as possible for sparse visitation) and contacting only one person per group. Visitors were informed of the survey effort and asked to participate. Willing participants provided their name, mailing address, and preference for language (English or Spanish) and were given a small token incentive (for example, a magnet or sticker) for their participation. Survey recruiters were also instructed to record any refusals and then proceed with the sampling protocol. All visitors that agreed onsite to fill out a survey received the same sequence of correspondence. This approach allowed for an assessment of visitors’ likelihood of completing the survey by their preferred survey mode (Sexton, Miller, and Dietsch 2011). Researchers at OSU sent the following materials to all visitors agreeing to participate who had not yet completed a survey at the time of each mailing (Dillman, Smyth, and Christian 2014): A postcard mailed within 10 days of the initial onsite contact thanking visitors for agreeing to participate in the survey and inviting them to complete the survey online. A packet mailed 14 days later consisting of a cover letter, survey, and postage paid envelope for returning a completed paper survey. A reminder postcard mailed 14 days later. A second packet mailed 7 days later consisting of another cover letter, survey, and postage paid envelope for returning a completed paper survey. Each mailing included instructions for completing the survey online, so visitors had an opportunity to complete an online survey with each mailing. Those visitors indicating a preference for Spanish were sent Spanish versions of all correspondence (including the survey). Online survey data were exported and paper survey data were entered into Microsoft Excel using a standardized survey codebook and data entry procedure. All survey data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, v.23) software.1 3.2 Sampling at This Refuge A total of 291 visitors agreed to participate in the survey during the two sampling periods at the identified locations at Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge Table 3.1. In all, 291 visitors completed the survey for a 100% response rate, and 10% margin of error at the 95% confidence level.2 Table: (#tab:sampling-dates) 3.3 Interpreting the Results The extent to which these results accurately represent the total population of visitors to this refuge is dependent on the number of visitors who completed the survey (sample size) and the ability of the variation resulting from that sample to reflect the beliefs and interests of different visitor user groups (Scheaffer et al. 2011). The composition of the sample is dependent on the ability of the standardized sampling protocol for this study to account for the spatial and temporal patterns of visitor use unique to each refuge. Spatially, the geographical layout and public-use infrastructure varies widely across refuges. Some refuges can be accessed only through a single entrance, while others have multiple unmonitored access points across large expanses of land and water. As a result, the degree to which sampling locations effectively captured spatial patterns of visitor use will vary from refuge to refuge. Temporally, the two 14-day sampling periods may not have effectively captured all of the predominant visitor uses/activities on some refuges during the course of a year, which may result in certain survey measures such as visitors’ self-reported “primary activity during their visit” reflecting a seasonality bias. Results contained within this report may not apply to visitors during all times of the year or to visitors who did not visit the survey locations. In this report, visitors who responded to the survey are referred to simply as “visitors.” However, when interpreting the results for Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, any potential spatial and temporal sampling limitation specific to this refuge needs to be considered when generalizing the results to the total population of visitors. For example, a refuge that sampled during a special event (for example, birding festival) held during the spring may have contacted a higher percentage of visitors who traveled greater than 50 miles to get to the refuge than the actual number of these people who would have visited throughout the calendar year (that is, oversampling of nonlocals). Another refuge may not have enough nonlocal visitors in the sample to adequately represent the beliefs and opinions of that group type. If the sample for a specific group type (for example, nonlocals, hunters, visitors who paid a fee) is too low (n &lt; 30), a warning is included in the text. Finally, the term “this visit” is used to reference the visit during which people were contacted to participate in the survey. References "],
["visit.html", "4 Visitor and Trip Characteristics 4.1 Visitor Characteristics 4.2 Participation in Outdoor Activities 4.3 Visiting This Refuge", " 4 Visitor and Trip Characteristics Data collected as part of this survey provides a baseline from which to understand who currently visits the refuge, and who engages in the multitude of activities offered by the refuge. Baseline data also allow refuge staff and others to assess any potential changes in visitor characteristics over time, which is core to the scientific foundation of the Service’s Inventory and Monitoring Initiative (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2017). 4.1 Visitor Characteristics In particular, depictions of the demographics (e.g., age, economic status, education, race and ethnicity) of both local and non-local visitors can inform refuge managers about which groups of people are directly benefitting from what the refuge currently offers. This type of visitor data can then be compared with future visitor data to assess changes in visitation due to various conditions (e.g., shifts in climate, resource, staff, or infrastructure). Visitor demographics can also be compared to the demographic composition of nearby communities using data from U.S. Census, the American Community Survey, or through online tools such as Social Explorer (www.socialexplorer.com) to assess whether the nearby community composition is reflected within refuge visitation, which is a critical component of getting to know and relate to the community (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Such data can also determine what new audiences from the local community - if not currently reflected in the visitor population - could potentially be engaged through appropriately-targeted outreach efforts (e.g., building partnerships, enhancing stepping stones of engagement; (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014)). Visitors to Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge were 51% male (with an average age of 56 years) and 44% female (with an average age of 54 years). Visitors, on average, reported they had 16 years of formal education (equivalent to College). The median level of income was $50,000-$74,999. See (AppendixB) for more demographic information. 4.2 Participation in Outdoor Activities Quality recreational experiences on refuges provide opportunities for visitors to connect with nature and the outdoors. Specifically, wildlife-dependent recreation, such as hunting, fishing, wildlife observation or photography, environmental education, and interpretation, can increase visitor appreciation and knowledge of natural resources (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). The survey collected data on recreation participation at this refuge during the past 12 months and the primary activity of each visitor when they were contacted about the survey. Understanding recreation participation can help to guide the allocation of resources, including staff and infrastructure, to ensure visitors have quality, memorable experiences. Understanding visitor uses of the refuge can also aid in developing programs that facilitate meaningful interactions between visitors and refuge staff. Finally, such information can also help to pinpoint locations on the refuge where potential interactions over refuge uses may be perceived as incompatible by different visitor groups. Anticipating and preventing any social conflicts over refuge use can help create a quality experience and foster personal and emotional connections to the refuge and its resources (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Refuge visitors were asked about twenty different activities they may have participated in at this refuge during the 12 months prior to completing the survey as well as the primary activity they participated in during this visit. Frequencies of all twenty activities are included in (AppendixB). Wildlife observation (74%) Hiking/Walking (69%) Bird watching (57%) Refuge visitors were also given the opportunity to write-in other activities if they were not included in the list of twenty activities. The full list of ‘other reported activities are included in (AppendixC). Some of the unique activities reported at this refuge included: Wildlife observation (74%) Hiking/Walking (69%) Bird watching (57%) 4.2.1 Primary Activities The primary activities reported at this refuge included: Hiking/Walking (28%) Bird watching (16%) Wildlife observation (13%) 4.3 Visiting This Refuge Understanding trends in overall visitation to this refuge provides refuge staff with key information about its existing audiences. Specifically, the survey explored the number of times visitors have been to this refuge during the past year, including during which seasons, and the trips taken to other refuges or other public lands for the same primary activities. In combination with other trip characteristics (e.g., trip purpose, time spent traveling to and visiting the refuge), such information can be used to better understand activity and site fidelity (i.e., likelihood of repeating specific past behavior) or substitutability (i.e., likelihood of doing another activity or visiting somewhere else to participate in a preferred activity). Such information regarding site fidelity in particular can also help to identify the success of existing communications at enticing different groups of people to visit the refuge. Information on seasonality of visits can help refuge staff anticipate when certain recreational activities or programming is in high demand, an important informational need for allocating appropriate resources. Some of the key questions related to visitation habits to this refuge included: Which of the following best describes your most recent visit to this refuge? How many people were in your personal group, including yourself, on your most recent visit to this refuge? Approximately how many hours/minutes (one-way) did you travel from your home to this refuge? 4.3.1 Visits to refuge In the last 12 months, how many times have you visited this refuge (including this visit)? 35% of visitors visited the refuge only once in the last 12 months 11% of visitors visited the refuge two times in the last 12 months 4.3.2 Visits to other national wildlife refuges In the last 12 months, how many times have you visited other national wildlife refuges? 74% of visitors did not visit any other national wildlife refuges in the last 12 months 21% of visitors visited other national wildlife refuges only once in the last 12 months 25% of visitors visited other national wildlife refuges two times in the last 12 months 4.3.3 Visits to other public lands In the last 12 months, how many times have you visited other public lands (for example, national or state parks) to participate in the same primary activity as this visit? 28% of visitors did not visit any other public lands 9% of visitors visited other public lands only once 14% of visitors visited other public lands two times References "],

Additionally, the Refuge System’s success in reaching new and diverse audiences depends on its ability to keep pace with communication trends (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2016a). Understanding how visitors both seek out and share information about the refuge and its resources using various communication channels (e.g., printed information, friends and family, websites, social media) can inform the refuge’s approach to communicating with visitors at different points of their trips (before, during and after). Information in this section can be used to assess changes in what sources are used as well as how visitors perceive the helpfulness of Service communications over time. Refuge staff can use communication channels preferred by visitors to inform the public about the Refuge System’s mission and accomplishments. 5.1 Learning about This Refuge The survey asked which information sources visitors used to learn about the refuge and its resources and the degree to which each information source was helpful. Visitors across different ages may use different information sources to learn about this refuge and its resources.

["opin.html", "6 Visitor Opinions about this Refuge 6.1 Overall Satisfaction 6.2 Recreational Opportunities 6.3 Services and Facilities 6.4 Feeling Safe and Welcome", " 6 Visitor Opinions about this Refuge A baseline understanding of visitor experiences provides a framework from which the Refuge System can monitor trends in visitor experiences and opinions overtime. Obtaining such a baseline is integral to the Service’s Inventory and Monitoring Initiative (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2017), as well as warranted if the Service is to remain relevant in the face of changing demographics and wildlife-related interests (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). As part of the survey, visitors rated both the importance of different serv, facilities, and opportunities on the refuge, and their satisfaction with each of the things applicable to their refuge experience. Certain services or recreational opportunities may be more or less central to the experience of different segments of the visitor population, and the potential for highly varied importance ratings needs to be considered when viewing the satisfaction results of this analysis. For example, hunters may place more importance on hunting opportunities and amenities, while school-group leaders may place more importance on educational/informational displays. Thus, a specialized user group’s importance of and satisfaction with a particular attribute may differ from the overall importance of and satisfaction with that same attribute for the full sample of visitors summarized in this report. 6.1 Overall Satisfaction The vast majority of surveyed visitors were satisfied with the refuge’s job of conserving fish, wildlife, and their habitats (83%) and the quality of the overall experience when visiting this refuge (87%). The next step is to compare the importance and satisfaction ratings for visitor services provided by refuges in order to identify how well different services meet visitor expectations. refSatTitle 6.2 Recreational Opportunities 6.2.1 Importance of Recreational Opportunities Figure 6.1: How important are the recreation opportunities? 6.2.2 Satisfaction with Recreational Opportunities Figure 6.2: How satisfied are you with the recreation opportunities? 6.3 Services and Facilities 6.3.1 Importance of Facilities and Services servicesImpTitle Figure 6.3: How important are the items? 6.3.2 Satisfaction with Facilities and Services servSatTitle Figure 6.4: Rate how satisfied you are with the way this refuge is managing each feature 6.4 Feeling Safe and Welcome People who rarely participate in wildlife-dependent recreation or do not regularly visit refuges may have different perspectives on the role of a refuge and its resources in everyday life compared to people who regularly visit a refuge or frequently participate in wildlife-dependent recreation. Visitors, particularly those new to ‘being in nature’, may have a sense of danger when outdoors or general discomfort associated with the unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Additionally, some people may perceive the refuge to lack materials or programs accessible and relevant to their interests, or may even believe that natural places are unwelcoming because of historical associations with the outdoors. Thus, an understanding of how visitors rate their feelings of being safe and welcome on the refuge can provide important baseline information to refuge staff when identifying potential areas for improvement and evaluating how future efforts may enhance feelings of being safe and welcome at refuges over time. safeTitle References "],
["trans.html", "7 Transportation at this Refuge 7.1 Travel To This Refuge 7.2 Transportation-related Features 7.3 Alternative Transportation Options", " 7 Transportation at this Refuge Transportation networks connect local communities to refuges and are the bedrock of all experiences that occur on refuges. Visitors access refuges by car, by boat, by bike, and by plane. The Service works to ensure that the roads, trails and parking areas are welcoming and safe for visitors of all abilities.These networks include roads, bridges, foot pathways, entrances, and the entire suite of transportation features critical to visitor access and mobility. While many visitors arrive at the refuge in private vehicles, other options (including buses, trams, watercraft, and bicycles) are increasingly becoming a part of the visitor experience. Thus, there is a critical need to know how visitors perceive the safety of using these different transportation options, as well as different transportation features (e.g., bridges, roadways, entrances/exists) as part of their experience. The survey asked visitors to rate both the importance and current satisfaction with existing transportation-related features, as well as methods of transportation visitors used to get to and around the refuge during their visit. This information can help to identify if transportation improvements could be made that would further enhance visitor access and, ultimately, their overall experiences (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Additionally, transportation alternatives within the Refuge System (Krechmer et al. 2001; Volpe Center 2010) could help to improve refuge conditions (e.g., quality of air, water, and habitat); thus, the survey asked visitors to note different transportation methods used during their trips, and their likelihood of using alternative transportation at refuges in the future. 7.1 Travel To This Refuge The key mode of transportation used by visitors to travel to this refuge was Private vehicle without trailer (86%; fig. 11). The key mode of transportation used by visitors to travel around this refuge was Foot (46%). Figure 11. Modes of transportation used by visitors to travel to and around Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge during this visit (n = ###). See Appendix C for a listing of “other” modes of transportation.

They were most satisfied with x and least satisfied with y Figure 7.2. Figure 7.1: Importance of transportation-related features when visiting this refuge Figure 7.2: Rate how satisfied you are with the way this refuge is managing each feature 7.3 Alternative Transportation Options One goal of the Transportation Program is to provide alternative modes and means of access to FWS managed lands as a way to enhance the visitation experience. “Access to FWS managed lands, where compatible with Station purpose, should be available to visitors via multiple forms of transportation, including public transit, bicycle, and walking. Alternative forms of transportation can help reduce visitors’ carbon footprints, which in turn may have long term positive affects for the natural resources we manage. Planning and building to accommodate sustainable transportation options can help to achieve the FWS mission (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2016b). Of six alternative transportation options listed on the survey, a majority of refuge visitors were likely to use the following at Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge in the future Figure 7.3: Pedestrian paths for access to this refuge from the local community (23%) Bus or tram that provides a guided tour (15%) Bike-share program that offers bicycles for rent on or near this refuge (14%) A majority of visitors indicated they were not likely to use Public transit systems that stops at or near this refuge.

["econ.html", "8 Visitor Spending in the Local Communities 8.1 Visitor Spending in the Local Communities", " 8 Visitor Spending in the Local Communities Tourists tend to buy a range of goods and services while visiting an area, such as a city or town located adjacent to a refuge. Major expenditure categories include lodging, food, supplies, and gasoline. Spending associated with refuge visitation can generate considerable economic benefits for local communities. For example, more than 46.5 million visits were made to refuges in fiscal year 2011, and generated $2.4 billion in sales, more than 35,000 jobs, and $792.7 million in employment income in regional economies (Carver and Caudill 2013). Information on the amount and types of visitor expenditures in relation to particular recreation activities (e.g., hunting, fishing, wildlife observation) has further illustrated the economic importance of recreation (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Census Bureau 2018), which are the primary reasons for which visitors seek out refuges and related resources. Finally, visitor expenditure information can be used to determine the potential economic impact of proposed refuge management alternatives into the future. 8.1 Visitor Spending in the Local Communities Visitors that live within the local 50-mi area of a refuge typically have different spending patterns than those that travel from longer distances. During the two sampling periods, 62% of surveyed visitors to Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge indicated that they live within the local 50-mi area while nonlocal visitors (30%) stayed in the local area, on average, for NA days. (tab:expendTable) shows summary statistics for local and nonlocal visitor expenditures in the local communities and at the refuge, with expenditures reported on a per person per day basis. During the two sampling periods, nonlocal visitors (n = 30) spent an average of $140.17 per person per day and local visitors spent an average of $105.91 per person per day in the local area. It is important to note that summary statistics based on a small sample size (n &lt; 30) may not provide a reliable representation of that population. Several factors should be considered when estimating the economic importance of refuge-visitor spending in the local communities. These factors include the amount of time spent at the refuge, influence of the refuge on the visitors’ decision to take this trip, and the representativeness of primary activities of the sample of surveyed visitors compared to the general population. Controlling for these factors is beyond the scope of the summary statistics presented in this report.

["smed.html", "9 Sharing Refuge Experiences Via Social Media", " 9 Sharing Refuge Experiences Via Social Media Around 70% of Americans use social media to connect with one another, engage with news content, share information and entertain themselves (Smith and Anderson 2018). Understanding the role of social media can expand the reach of Service communication efforts and direct ways to better reach the next generation of refuge visitors, a major emphasis of the Service’s recommendations for Conserving the Future (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Building and maintaining an official presence on social media can also enhance two-way conversations between visitors and refuge staff, a critical element of the Service’s Communication’s Strategy (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2016a). Two-way communication may also help to enhance trust of the agency by highlighting the range of visitor experiences that are welcomed and stories of refuges experiences from the perspective of culturally-relevant groups (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Finally, a social media presence can further generate awareness of the refuge and its resources among audiences that do not use, or did not otherwise learn about the refuge through traditional advertising outlets. In an increasingly urbanized society, social media is how a lot of younger generations are getting introduced to outdoor spaces for the first time. Visitors were asked if they used social media to share their refuge experience with others. Potential visitors may find these shared posts when searching for information online about the refuge, specific locations, or particular wildlife - or simply when searching about their friend or family member’s activities; thus, social media posts can serve as a virtual “word of mouth” method of increasing awareness about the refuge to the visitor’s network and beyond. More/Less than half of visitors (r“XX%”`) reported using social media to share their refuge experience with other people. The full list of social media outlets presented to visitors is contained in Appendix B. 9.0.1 Social Media Sharing by Age Group While Millennials have often led older Americans in their adoption and use of technology, including social media, there has been significant growth in tech adoption in recent years among older generations. More than half of Baby Boomers say they use social media. Among all visitors, the following social media outlets were used most often to share refuge experiences: None (47%) Facebook (39%) Instagram (14%) Visitors under the age of 35 most often used these social media outlets to share refuge experiences: None (47%) Facebook (39%) Instagram (14%) Visitors over the age of 35 most often used these social media outlets to share refuge experiences: None (47%) Facebook (39%) Instagram (14%) References "],
["futvis.html", "10 Enhancing Future Visits to National Wildlife Refuges 10.1 Forecasting Future Recreation Demand at This Refuge 10.2 Visitor Programs", " 10 Enhancing Future Visits to National Wildlife Refuges 10.1 Forecasting Future Recreation Demand at This Refuge Gaining a sense of what would encourage visitors to return (or what may prevent them from returning) would be useful information for managers, planners, and visitor services personnel. For example, some visitors may prefer increased infrastructure, while others may want more access to opportunities on the refuge. However, any management action aimed at increasing recreation participation should be considered in relation to possible effects on different visitor groups. For example, visitors may report that more infrastructure would lead to increased participation in a particular primary activity (e.g., birdwatching, fishing), but that particular increased participation could also result in others feeling crowded, subsequently reducing their participation. Thus, results in this section should be considered as part of a network of potential decisions that could affect different visitor groups disproportionally if not carefully considered in full. 10.2 Visitor Programs Offering programming that is equitable to various groups of visitors at refuges, whether located in urban areas or elsewhere, will help to build a stronger conservation constituency into the future (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Creation and administration of different types of programs can encourage people to continue visiting the refuge, and further build relationships and encourage visitation among new audiences. These opportunities can focus a variety of interests and topics ranging from skill-building, specific youth programs, family-based or multi-generational programs, or showcasing local or unique culture. Programs that focus on the interests of these varied audiences in order to foster stronger connections to the refuge and its resources may ultimately help to enhance conservation goals.

["concl.html", "11 Conclusion", " 11 Conclusion These individual refuge results provide a summary of trip characteristics and experiences of a sample of visitors to Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge during 2018 and are intended to inform decision-making efforts related to visitor services and transportation at this refuge. Additionally, the results from this survey can be used to inform planning efforts, such as a refuge’s Comprehensive Conservation Plan. With an understanding of visitors’ trip and activity characteristics, and visitor-satisfaction ratings with existing offerings, refuge managers are able to make informed decisions about possible modifications (whether a reduction or enhancement) to visitor facilities, services, or recreational opportunities. This information can help managers gauge demand for refuge opportunities and inform both implementation and communication strategies. Similarly, an awareness of visitors’ satisfaction ratings with various refuge offerings can help determine if potential areas of concern need to be investigated further. As another example of the utility of these results, community relations may be improved or bolstered through an understanding of the value of the refuge to visitors, whether that value is attributed to an appreciation of the refuge’s offerings, enjoyment of its recreational activities, or spending contributions of nonlocal visitors to the local economy. Such data about visitors and their experiences, in conjunction with an understanding of biophysical data on the refuge and its resources, can ensure that management decisions are consistent with the Refuge System mission while fostering a continued public interest in these special places.

The survey was peer-reviewed by academic and government researchers. The survey and associated methodology were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB control #: 0596-0236; expiration date: 11/30/2020). A.3 Contacting Visitors Refuge staff identified two separate 14-day sampling periods, and one or more locations at which to sample, that best reflected the diversity of use and specific visitation patterns of each participating refuge. A standardized sampling schedule was created for all refuges that included eight randomly selected sampling shifts during each of the two sampling periods. Sampling shifts were four (hr) time bands, stratified across AM and PM as well as weekend and weekdays. In coordination with refuge staff, any necessary customizations were made to the standardized schedule to accommodate the identified sampling locations and to address specific spatial and temporal patterns of visitation. Twenty visitors (18 years of age or older) per sampling shift were systematically selected, for a total of 400 willing participants per refuge (or 200 per sampling period) to ensure an adequate sample of completed surveys. When necessary, shifts were moved, added, or extended to alleviate logistical limitations (for example, weather or low visitation at a particular site) in an effort to reach target numbers. American Conservation Experience Interns and/or USFWS Human Dimensions staff (survey recruiters) contacted visitors onsite following a protocol provided by OSU that was designed to obtain a representative sample. Instructions included contacting visitors across the entire sampling shift (for example, every nth visitor for dense visitation, as often as possible for sparse visitation) and contacting only one person per group. Visitors were informed of the survey effort, given a token incentive (for example, a small magnet or temporary tattoo), and asked to participate. Willing participants provided their name, mailing address, and preference for language (English or Spanish). Survey recruiters were also instructed to record any refusals and then proceed with the sampling protocol All visitors that agreed onsite to fill out a survey received the same sequence of correspondence. This approach allowed for an assessment of visitors' likelihood of completing the survey by their preferred survey mode (Sexton, Miller, and Dietsch 2011). Researchers at OSU sent the following materials to all visitors agreeing to participate who had not yet completed a survey at the time of each mailing (Dillman, Smyth, and Christian 2014): A postcard mailed within 10 days of the initial onsite contact thanking visitors for agreeing to participate in the survey and inviting them to complete the survey online. A packet mailed 14 days later consisting of a cover letter, survey, and postage paid envelope for returning a completed paper survey. A reminder postcard mailed 14 days later. A second packet mailed 7 days later consisting of another cover letter, survey, and postage paid envelope for returning a completed paper survey. Each mailing included instructions for completing the survey online, so visitors had an opportunity to complete an online survey with each mailing. Those visitors indicating a preference for Spanish were sent Spanish versions of all correspondence (including the survey). Online survey data were exported and paper survey data were entered into Microsoft Excel using a standardized survey codebook and data entry procedure. All survey data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, v.23) and R software3. A.4 Interpreting the Results The extent to which these results accurately represent the total population of visitors to this refuge is dependent on the number of visitors who completed the survey (sample size) and the ability of the variation resulting from that sample to reflect the beliefs and interests of different visitor user groups (Scheaffer and others, 1996). The composition of the sample is dependent on the ability of the standardized sampling protocol for this study to account for the spatial and temporal patterns of visitor use unique to each refuge. Spatially, the geographical layout and public-use infrastructure varies widely across refuges. Some refuges can be accessed only through a single entrance, while others have multiple unmonitored access points across large expanses of land and water. As a result, the degree to which sampling locations effectively captured spatial patterns of visitor use will vary from refuge to refuge. Temporally, the two 14-day sampling periods may not have effectively captured all of the predominant visitor uses/activities on some refuges during the course of a year, which may result in certain survey measures such as visitors' self-reported “primary activity during their visit” reflecting a seasonality bias. Results contained within this report may not apply to visitors during all times of the year or to visitors who did not visit the survey locations. In this report, visitors who responded to the survey are referred to simply as “visitors.” However, when interpreting the results for Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, any potential spatial and temporal sampling limitation specific to this refuge needs to be considered when generalizing the results to the total population of visitors. For example, a refuge that sampled during a special event (for example, birding festival) held during the spring may have contacted a higher percentage of visitors who traveled greater than 50 miles (mi) to get to the refuge than the actual number of these people who would have visited throughout the calendar year (that is, oversampling of nonlocals). Another refuge may not have enough nonlocal visitors in the sample to adequately represent the beliefs and opinions of that group type. If the sample for a specific group type (for example, nonlocals, hunters, visitors who paid a fee) is too low (n &amp;lt; 30), a warning is included in the text. Finally, the term “this visit” is used to reference the visit during which people were contacted to participate in the survey. A.5 Non-Response Bias Non-response bias is the bias that results when respondents differ in meaningful ways from nonrespondents. Non-response bias affects the ability to generalize survey results, to some degree and in some ways, from the sample to the study’s target population (Dillman, Smyth, and Christian 2014, Salant and Dillman (1994)). If non-respondents are found to differ from respondents in meaningful ways, care should be taken when interpreting survey responses, as they may overrepresent some segments of the target population to some degree, and may under-represent other segments of the population to some degree. To check for non-response bias, this study used answers to three non-response bias questions and three observable characteristics of the contacted visitor to compare respondents with nonrespondents. The following questions and observations were used for evaluation of non-response bias: - What is your primary activity at the refuge today? - Do you live within 50 miles of this refuge? - What year were you born? In addition to the three non-response bias questions, the following three characteristics were observed and recorded: - Gender of the person in the group who was first contacted by the survey recruiter - Number of adults (18 years and older) in the group - Number of children (under 18 years) in the group Ideally, responses or observed estimates for non-response bias variables should be collected from all respondents and non-respondents. The collection of information from all contacted individuals provides the best comparison of characteristics between the respondent and non-respondent populations. More practically, a majority of responses or observed estimates must be present to adequately characterize both the respondent and non-respondent populations. In this study, 70% was identified as the minimum percentage of valid values for non-response variables needed for both respondent and non-respondent populations in order to adequately characterize the populations on a given non-response variable. All non-response variables met the minimum for 70% valid values among respondents and/or non-respondents 11.2. Correspondingly, all variables were used for non-response bias analysis.
