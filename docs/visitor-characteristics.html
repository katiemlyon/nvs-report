<h1>Visitor Characteristics</h1>

<div class="preamble1">
Depictions of the demographics (e.g., age, economic status, education, race and ethnicity) of both local and non-local visitors can inform refuge managers about which groups of people are directly benefitting from what the refuge currently offers. This type of visitor data can then be compared with future visitor data to assess changes in visitation due to various conditions (e.g., shifts in climate, resource, staff, or infrastructure). Visitor demographics can also be compared to the demographic composition of nearby communities using data from U.S. Census, the American Community Survey, or through online tools such as Social Explorer (www.socialexplorer.com) to assess whether the nearby community composition is reflected within refuge visitation, which is a critical component of getting to know and relate to the community <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Such data can also determine what new audiences from the local community - if not currently reflected in the visitor population - could potentially be engaged through appropriately-targeted outreach efforts (e.g., building partnerships, enhancing stepping stones of engagement; <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>).

Effective communication with the public is critical for managing and enhancing visitor experiences. Additionally, the Refuge System’s success in reaching new and diverse audiences depends on its ability to keep pace with communication trends <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2016a" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a><a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2016a" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. Understanding how visitors both seek out and share information about the refuge and its resources using various communication channels (e.g., printed information, friends and family, websites, social media) can inform the refuge’s approach to communicating with visitors at different points of their trips (before, during and after). Information in this section can be used to assess changes in what sources are used as well as how visitors perceive the helpfulness of Service communications over time. Refuge staff can use communication channels preferred by visitors to inform the public about the Refuge System’s mission and accomplishments.

<h2>Participation in Outdoor Activities</h2>

<div class="preamble1">
<p>Quality recreational experiences on refuges provide opportunities for visitors to connect with nature and the outdoors. Specifically, wildlife-dependent recreation, such as hunting, fishing, wildlife observation or photography, environmental education, and interpretation, can increase visitor appreciation and knowledge of natural resources <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. The survey collected data on recreation participation at this refuge during the past 12 months and the primary activity of each visitor when they were contacted about the survey. Understanding recreation participation can help to guide the allocation of resources, including staff and infrastructure, to ensure visitors have quality, memorable experiences. Understanding visitor uses of the refuge can also aid in developing programs that facilitate meaningful interactions between visitors and refuge staff. Finally, such information can also help to pinpoint locations on the refuge where potential interactions over refuge uses may be perceived as incompatible by different visitor groups. Anticipating and preventing any social conflicts over refuge use can help create a quality experience and foster personal and emotional connections to the refuge and its resources <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2>Visiting This Refuge</h2>

<div class="preamble1">
Understanding trends in overall visitation to this refuge provides refuge staff with key information about its existing audiences. Specifically, the survey explored the number of times visitors have been to this refuge during the past year, including during which seasons, and the trips taken to other refuges or other public lands for the same primary activities. In combination with other trip characteristics (e.g., trip purpose, time spent traveling to and visiting the refuge), such information can be used to better understand activity and site fidelity (i.e., likelihood of repeating specific past behavior) or substitutability (i.e., likelihood of doing another activity or visiting somewhere else to participate in a preferred activity). Such information regarding site fidelity in particular can also help to identify the success of existing communications at enticing different groups of people to visit the refuge. Information on seasonality of visits can help refuge staff anticipate when certain recreational activities or programming is in high demand, an important informational need for allocating appropriate resources.

Visitor Experiences

<p>{-#vistor-experiences}</p>

<div class="preamble1">
A baseline understanding of visitor experiences provides a framework from which the Refuge System can monitor trends in visitor experiences and opinions overtime. Obtaining such a baseline is integral to the Service’s Inventory and Monitoring Initiative <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, as well as warranted if the Service is to remain relevant in the face of changing demographics and wildlife-related interests <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. As part of the survey, visitors rated both the importance of different serv, facilities, and opportunities on the refuge, and their satisfaction with each of the things applicable to their refuge experience. Certain services or recreational opportunities may be more or less central to the experience of different segments of the visitor population, and the potential for highly varied importance ratings needs to be considered when viewing the satisfaction results of this analysis. For example, hunters may place more importance on hunting opportunities and amenities, while school-group leaders may place more importance on educational/informational displays. Thus, a specialized user group’s importance of and satisfaction with a particular attribute may differ from the overall importance of and satisfaction with that same attribute for the full sample of visitors summarized in this report.

<h2>Overall Satisfaction</h2>
<p>The vast majority of surveyed visitors were satisfied with the refuge’s job of conserving fish, wildlife, and their habitats (83%) and the quality of the overall experience when visiting this refuge (87%). The next step is to compare the importance and satisfaction ratings for visitor services provided by refuges in order to identify how well different services meet visitor expectations.</p>

<h2>Feeling Safe and Welcome</h2>

<div class="preamble1">
People who rarely participate in wildlife-dependent recreation or do not regularly visit refuges may have different perspectives on the role of a refuge and its resources in everyday life compared to people who regularly visit a refuge or frequently participate in wildlife-dependent recreation. Visitors, particularly those new to ‘being in nature’, may have a sense of danger when outdoors or general discomfort associated with the unknown <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Additionally, some people may perceive the refuge to lack materials or programs accessible and relevant to their interests, or may even believe that natural places are unwelcoming because of historical associations with the outdoors. Thus, an understanding of how visitors rate their feelings of being safe and welcome on the refuge can provide important baseline information to refuge staff when identifying potential areas for improvement and evaluating how future efforts may enhance feelings of being safe and welcome at refuges over time.

Travel, Transportation and Access
</h1>
<p>{-#transportation}</p>

<div class="preamble1">
Transportation networks connect local communities to refuges and are the bedrock of all experiences that occur on refuges. Visitors access refuges by car, by boat, by bike, and by plane. The Service works to ensure that the roads, trails and parking areas are welcoming and safe for visitors of all abilities.These networks include roads, bridges, foot pathways, entrances, and the entire suite of transportation features critical to visitor access and mobility. While many visitors arrive at the refuge in private vehicles, other options (including buses, trams, watercraft, and bicycles) are increasingly becoming a part of the visitor experience. Thus, there is a critical need to know how visitors perceive the safety of using these different transportation options, as well as different transportation features (e.g., bridges, roadways, entrances/exists) as part of their experience. The survey asked visitors to rate both the importance and current satisfaction with existing transportation-related features, as well as methods of transportation visitors used to get to and around the refuge during their visit. This information can help to identify if transportation improvements could be made that would further enhance visitor access and, ultimately, their overall experiences <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. Additionally, transportation alternatives within the Refuge System <span class="citation">(Krechmer et al. <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-krechmer2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Volpe Center <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-volpe2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> could help to improve refuge conditions (e.g., quality of air, water, and habitat); thus, the survey asked visitors to note different transportation methods used during their trips, and their likelihood of using alternative transportation at refuges in the future.

<h2>Alternative Transportation Options</h2>
<p>One goal of the Transportation Program is to provide alternative modes and means of access to FWS managed lands as a way to enhance the visitation experience. "Access to FWS managed lands, where compatible with Station purpose, should be available to visitors via multiple forms of transportation, including public transit, bicycle, and walking. Alternative forms of transportation can help reduce visitors’ carbon footprints, which in turn may have long term positive affects for the natural resources we manage. Planning and building to accommodate sustainable transportation options can help to achieve the FWS mission <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2016b" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a><a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2016b" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>.</p>

Visitor Spending in the Local Communities
</h1>
<p>{-#econ}</p>

<div class="preamble1">
Tourists tend to buy a range of goods and services while visiting an area, such as a city or town located adjacent to a refuge. Major expenditure categories include lodging, food, supplies, and gasoline. Spending associated with refuge visitation can generate considerable economic benefits for local communities. For example, more than 46.5 million visits were made to refuges in fiscal year 2011, and generated $2.4 billion in sales, more than 35,000 jobs, and $792.7 million in employment income in regional economies <span class="citation">(Carver and Caudill <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-carver2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Information on the amount and types of visitor expenditures in relation to particular recreation activities (e.g., hunting, fishing, wildlife observation) has further illustrated the economic importance of recreation <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Census Bureau <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, which are the primary reasons for which visitors seek out refuges and related resources. Finally, visitor expenditure information can be used to determine the potential economic impact of proposed refuge management alternatives into the future.

<div id="visitor-spending-in-the-local-communities" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Visitor Spending in the Local Communities</h2>
<p>Visitors that live within the local 50-mi area of a refuge typically have different spending patterns than those that travel from longer distances. During the two sampling periods, 62% of surveyed visitors to Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge indicated that they live within the local 50-mi area while nonlocal visitors (30%) stayed in the local area, on average, for NA days. (tab:expendTable) shows summary statistics for local and nonlocal visitor expenditures in the local communities and at the refuge, with expenditures reported on a per person per day basis. During the two sampling periods, nonlocal visitors (<em>n</em> = 30) spent an average of $140.17 per person per day and local visitors spent an average of $105.91 per person per day in the local area. It is important to note that summary statistics based on a small sample size (n &lt; 30) may not provide a reliable representation of that population. Several factors should be considered when estimating the economic importance of refuge-visitor spending in the local communities. These factors include the amount of time spent at the refuge, influence of the refuge on the visitors’ decision to take this trip, and the representativeness of primary activities of the sample of surveyed visitors compared to the general population. Controlling for these factors is beyond the scope of the summary statistics presented in this report.</p>

Future Visits to National Wildlife Refuges
</h1>
<p>{-#futvis}</p>

<div class="preamble1">
Gaining a sense of what would encourage visitors to return (or what may prevent them from returning) would be useful information for managers, planners, and visitor services personnel. For example, some visitors may prefer increased infrastructure, while others may want more access to opportunities on the refuge. However, any management action aimed at increasing recreation participation should be considered in relation to possible effects on different visitor groups. For example, visitors may report that more infrastructure would lead to increased participation in a particular primary activity (e.g., birdwatching, fishing), but that particular increased participation could also result in others feeling crowded, subsequently reducing their participation. Thus, results in this section should be considered as part of a network of potential decisions that could affect different visitor groups disproportionally if not carefully considered in full.

<h2>Visitor Programs</h2>

<div class="preamble1">
Offering programming that is equitable to various groups of visitors at refuges, whether located in urban areas or elsewhere, will help to build a stronger conservation constituency into the future <span class="citation">(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="page-title-chap1.html#ref-USFWS2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Creation and administration of different types of programs can encourage people to continue visiting the refuge, and further build relationships and encourage visitation among new audiences. These opportunities can focus a variety of interests and topics ranging from skill-building, specific youth programs, family-based or multi-generational programs, or showcasing local or unique culture. Programs that focus on the interests of these varied audiences in order to foster stronger connections to the refuge and its resources may ultimately help to enhance conservation goals.
