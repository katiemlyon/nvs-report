"1) CROSSING THE SINGLE LANE BRIDGE. OFTEN WHERE CARS WANT TO GO EACH WAY, IT SOMETIMES UNCLEAR AS TO WHO GOES & WHO WAITS. DON'T SEE THERE IS MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT. 2) WAITING FOR CARGO TRAINS (PASSENGER TRAINS ARE QUIET) BUT MOST OF THE ONES MOVING CARGO CAN GO AS LONG AS 10 MINUTES. AGAIN NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT."
"1) ONLY ONE (1) HANDICAPPED PARKING SPOT; NONE NEAR REST ROOMS. (2) HARD FOR TWO CARS GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO PASS EACH OTHER ON ENTRANCE/EXIT ROAD."
"260 boat ramp didn't have a permit in the box at the display. This box stayed empty all season so when new people come to hunt there isn't any permits. The game wardens will right tickets for not having these permits. they might want to go digital or online with these permits."
"3 generations love visiting this refuge."
"999                                                                     1"
"A ferry between Chesapeake Beach and the refuge would make the trip much shorter and enjoyable! It seems the transportation within the refuge was pretty good."
"a few of the trails have a large amount of poison ivy on them.  I'm pretty allergic and chose not to continue down those paths. It would be great it if could be cut back a bit more."
"A great experience. Some additional parking would be nice. The sing that directs one to the park is woefully lacking. Unless someone who knows where the park is accompanies the group, finding the park would be very difficult."
"A map with mileage/distance further in on the trail would be helpful for families to know how long the loop is and whether or not they would like to continue."
"A NEW BIKE PATH WAS BUILT ON CRAB ORCHARD CAMPGROUND ENTRY ROAD. IT WAS SEEDED WITH FOXTAIL AND IS UNMOWED & ALMOST UNUSABLE. CAMPGROUND ROADS NEED TO BE OILED & CHIPPED. VERY DUSTY."
"A receptacle for dog waste would be a nice addition to encourage people to pick up and dispose of properly."
"A second restroom located on the far side of the refuge (away from entrance) would be nice. I like to spend considerable time deep inside the refuge which usually results in a pit-stop in the bushes."
"A STOP AT DESK FOR CURRENT TRAIL/ROAD CONDITIONS AND ACCESSIBILITY BECAUSE OF FLOODING WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL!"
"A system detailing the gates that are open or closed would be very helpful."
"Absolutely beautiful views at Sachuest Point, RI. I am a Rhode Islander who travels to Newport routinely, but did not know about this until a local took me there."
"Access road is essentially one lane, but it has not been a problem."
"Access road is very narrow which is a problem on crowded days; Entrance signage is very small and easy to miss"
"Access road to refuge from main road is one of the worst roads on this island."
"access to the lake"
"Access to this refuge is mostly from public roads with few safe places to pull over. The provision of ""wildlife drives"" would be a great asset."
"Access to trailheads used to be marked more clearly before roads were changed. This could be improved through better signage and pull-offs"
"Additional pull out areas would be wonderful"
"Aditional parking areas would be nice, its unimproved anyway, so why force walking to get there? Gear gets heavy"
"All are in good condition and well maintained."
"All aspects are satisfactory at this time"
"All good"
"all good at Steigerwald"
"ALL SUCH SIGHTS SHOULD HAVE RV TURNAROUND AND RV PARKING. IT IS A DETERRANT IF SUCH IS NOT NOTED, NOT AVAILABLE OR TOO SMALL. WHEN RV'ING, A HUGE CONCERN IS PARKING AND TURNING AROUND. WE DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK! TRAIL AT BOTTOM OF CLIFF SPLITS, WITH NO SIGNAGE."
"Amazing refuge , we all loved the drive around trail."
"Apple maps takes you to the wrong side of the park and a smaller, less easily accessible entrance (you really need a truck to use that entrance). I submitted a request to update the app. Hopefully it works. The signs on the highway direct you to the correct location."
"Appreciate the signs warning people not to leave things in car -- we have been fortunate to not have car broken into but it's a problem in the area. Maybe cameras could help?"
"Are we allowed to walk the auto route now? It's not clear by signage but I have heard you can. Signage about this would be helpful."
"Areas where the roads tend to be washed out during lake flooding need to be raised or improved so they will not wash out. Bridges should be raised so they do not become water crossings during high water periods."
"as a blind person i do notice others riding bikes on the trails, motoroized scooter, and brining dogs or cats-that are NOT service dogs but are comfort dogs. Also we notice a lot of others dropping their passengers off at the beach then driving up to thepark and leaving their cars there for the day-no fee. also the exit only you see cars going in the wrong direction to get a quick parking space instead of going with the flow and following others. need more people out there, directing traffic."
"As I age, I would like to make it all the way through the park. I would like to see more auto access deeper into the park. ( with minimal impact on the wildlife)"
"As mentioned, the access road was very hard to find. The access road is in the midst of a neighborhood and if too many people knew about this place the neighbors would certainly be bothered"
"As noted, it wasn't clear at the entrance that there was more to the place than hunting and fishing since what was there was the hunting/fishing license station."
"As relatively recent residents in this area, this was our first visit to The Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. It will not be our last. I look forward to coming at various times of the year to experience the migration ""show""."
"ASIDE FROM THE AREA AROUND THE VISITOR CENTER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE REFUGE IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY DIRT ROAD AND IS RARELY VISITED, THEREBY KEEPING IT TRULY WILD."
"At one point near the end it was difficult to know which way to turn"
"At the south end of the bay, all parking is only on city streets. It would be nice to have a parking lot for visitors."
"At this point in my life I can navigate the refuge just fine from experience. I answered some questions based on my first impressions which are important if you expect repeat visitors."
"Bad pot holes entering parking lot. Large pile of gravel right there not being used."
"BAYOU LACOMBE NEEDS A RESTROOM. IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO NOT HAVE TO DRIVE TO A STORE DURING FISHING TRIPS."
"BAYOU LARAMBE TO ME ISN'T SET UP LIKE A NICE VISITOR REFUGE. IT HAS ONE OLDER SHELL ROAD IN & OUT."
"Beautiful area!"
"Beautiful place! Wouldn't have expected so many tree's! The scenery was beautiful!"
"Beautiful refuge. We visit often to view wintering waterfowl. If I were going to suggest any changes, it would be that the pullover spaces on the auto trail were bigger and more plentiful. It does get crowded occasionally. But I know the berm roads are limited in space so it's a trade-off."
"Beautiful, but not built for wheelchairs or walkers"
"Because it's a refuge I prefer the gravel roads and grass parking...keeping it natural is important."
"BECAUSE RI HAS A HIGH TICK POPULATION, I THINK THAT ONE SECTION OF THE LONGER LOOP TRAIL THAT HAS SOME GRASS ON THE MIDDLE OF IT (EVEN THOUGH THE GRASS IS CUT PRETTY LOW)SHOULD BE GROOMED SIMILARLY AS THE REST OF THE TRAIL IS IE CRUSHED STONE ETC."
"Benches are placed on trails at appropriate distances apart for us geezers to rest as needed."
"BETTER MILE MARKERS WOULD BE HELPFUL"
"Better signs and pull over spots"
"better signs around trails is needed. had to constantly ask where we we're or where we needed to go."
"BETTER SIGNS OFF OF MAIN ROAD"
"Better signs on the auto tour (length of each direction if split)"
"Better visibility would be nice to avoid head on collisions around sharp curves."
"Bicycle lanes could be a great addition"
"BICYCLES ARE NOT ALLOWED ON THE REFUGE PATH AROUND THE IMPOUNDMENTS BUT WE DO SEE PEOPLE ON BIKES THERE. MORE OBVIOUS SIGNAGE AT BOTH ENDS OF THE REFUGE WOULD HELP EDUCATE BIKERS. THE ENTRANCE ROAD IS VERY NARROW, NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR 2 CARTS TO PASS - ITIS ALSO A HAZARD FOR THE BIKES USING THE BIKE TRAIL IF THERE ARE DRIVERS PASS THRU THE INTERSECTION WITHOUT EXERCISING CAUTION. AGAIN - MORE SIGNAGE WOULD HELP."
"Bicycles can be disruptive for other activities like bird watching"
"Bicycles often go too fast on trails, impacting safety of hikers.  The parking area is clearly the biggest need for improvement. Too small, car break ins."
"BIKE TRAIL WAS SURROUNDED BY VERY HIGH/TALL WEEDS."
"Blackwater is a nice refuge and the roads, trails, and boardwalks are all very well maintained."
"BLACKWATER SOMETIMES IS A BIRDING BONANZA & THE ROADS ARE OKAY & THATS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME."
"Blade the road better"
"Boardwalk needs some repair. Beautiful place."
"BOARDWALKS LOOKED TO BE NEW VERY WELL MAINTAINED, NICE AND WIDE"
"boardwalks needed maintenance"
"Boat dock is very poorly maintained - unsafe"
"Boat launch could use some improvement"
"Boat launch is one of the best. Having a well maintained dual launch w/ plenty of room for parking boat trailers is very important to us."
"Boat ramp at dam needs work"
"Boat ramp on main reiver needs work. Its been bad for a few years."
"Boat ramps are complete junk! Please fix them."
"Boat ramps at the refuge could have been improved when lake was low but wasnt done. one ramp is decent , the other is so narrow it is difficult to launch on. do able but not fun with a larger boat,"
"Boat ramps need to be rebuilt. County roads around parts of the refuge can be very muddy and inaccessible at times. Would be nice if they were rocked/graveled.."
"Bridge at River S Unit was one-way, looked unsafe, and was hard to negotiate on raised, uneven timbers. Bridge needs replacement as well as Main Hqtrs, where I have purchased passes and met with employees. Signs in town are inadequate."
"Cannot have too much signage within the refuge to direct you to hunting sites during low light conditions."
"Canoe trails were clogged and limited access"
"Cars drive too fast on swamp drive, probably more than 20 mph"
"Clear and dry/sunny out"
"Clear map at the boat launch of where you are allowed to waterfowl hunt would be nice to have."
"COMMUNITY (SURROUNDING REFUGE) SEEMS LOW, ESPECIALLY LOCAL AFRIC AMER COMMUNITY. I SUGGEST INCREASING VISIBILITY WITH SIGNS IN AREA."
"Corn Creek is a great oasis and migrant trap for birds."
"Could have better signage and directions on roads."
"Could have had more or larger pull outs along refuge drive"
"COULD MAYBE USE A FEW MORE SIGNS ON THE REFUGE ROADS"
"could use a bigger parking lot. it's getting more popular every year."
"COULD USE A COUPLE MORE CAR PULL-OFF AREAS ALONG THE PRAIRIE AND WATER AREAS FOR PHOTOGRAPHY SO CARS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT."
"Could use a few more park benches on the refuge trails."
"Could use more parking"
"County Road is terrible. The county doesn't compact the gravel they install each year so it washes out immediately after installation."
"Crab Orchard is a wonderful place to take the family, enjoy a bike ride and see all of what nature has to offer."
"CROSS COUNTRY SKIING IS TOUGH WHEN TRAILS ARE TRACKED UP BY HIKERS AND DOGS."
"CURRENTLY, DUE TO REHAB ON HANALEI BEACH, DUE TO STORM DAMAGE, THERE WERE NO ACCESSIBLE BOAT LAUNCH OR ROADWAYS OPEN TO THE RIVER. ACCESSIBILITY TO RIVER WAS ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH KAYAK BUSINESS WHERE WE RENTED KAYAKS. OUR FRIENDS, WHO OWNED PERSONAL EQUIPMENT, WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPANY US."
"Desert wildlife refuge boasts beautiful counting and a lot of it but is inacessible without specialized vehicle, which is sad."
"Did encounter a few speeders on the nature auto loop drive."
"DID NOT NEED ACCESS HELP, BUT NOTICED THAT IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR OTHERS"
"DID NOT REALIZE NEEDED A 4-WHEEL TO GO ON ROADS. WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE OUR VISIT BECAUSE OF THIS"
"did not use"
"Did not use any of the roads or trails on the refuge. Entered the refuge by boat for hunting."
"Difficult to find. Signs do not do a good enough job at directing people to the refuge."
"DISABILITY ACCESS NOT IMPORTANT TO US, PERSONALLY, BUT APPEARED TO BE WELL PROVIDED FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. OTHER FEATURES SEEM APPROPRIATE FOR ITS FAIRLY LOW-IMPACT CHARACTER."
"Do not like the shuttle feature of the park; it would be nice to have option not to take the shuttle from the parking lot even if it meant walking from the parking area to the visitor center."
"Do not pave any more roads in the dwr. It will increase traffic it would make those areas too accessible. The cat roads are fine for those who wish to get there."
"do not pave trails as pavement hurts my feet and the feet of others with foot problems or people who do not even realize yet the damage that pavement and other hard surfaces causes!"
"Do not post signs. There are already too many people."
"Drive it yourself and answer your own questions"
"DRIVING ROUTE ""S"" UNIT - NEEDS MORE PULL OUTS. WOULD BE NICE IF THE WALK AREA WAS OPEN MORE THAN SUMMER MONTHS."
"Due to the conditions of the roads in this area, handicapped access is virtually non-existent."
"Easy access from main highways and local roadways"
"Easy to get around. Places to pull off to observe wildlife."
"easy to get to"
"Easy to navigate around roads in the refuge and there's plenty of space to easily maneuver my car in and around wildlife roads and areas."
"EDGES OF ROAD NEED THE GRASS CUT. MAINTANANCE IS POOR. PEOPLE IN CARS CAN'T ENJOY OR SEE WHEN GRASS IS TALLER THAN CAR!"
"Employees driving in the out exit constantly thru do not enter."
"Enjoyed paddler acces to refuge. I never would have discovered it otherwise!  Marsh trail was beautiful and well-maintained."
"Entrance from Bluffton and also the exit onto Hilton Head are bad.....but that is a problem with the roads....not the refuge. Often have to turn the opposite way and back track because of the traffic."
"Entrance is quite crappy most of the year. Big pot holes are all over the opening. Very rough on a boat trailer. Big pot holes form on the drive way going down as well, but those are mostly on one side of the road way."
"Entrance on route 420 as well as trails along 420 need more attention. Some are not passable during the summer."
"ENTRANCE TO PARKING AREA NOT WELL MARKED. ROADWAY TO PARKING LOT IS VERY NARROW."
"entrance to Pinkney can be difficult due to highway traffic"
"ENTRANCE WAS A LITTLE HARD TO FIND."
"Entrance/exit and parking lot need pavement; gravel does not work well. Trails would be much better if paved also. Gravel is very dusty and noisy for wildlife viewing."
"entry bridge is VERY old and one lane; entrance drive-way feels treacherous in wet weather"
"Even though crushed rock and gravel is used to reduce dust, it is still very dusty."
"Eventually, the single lane bridge over railroad tracks should be replaced for safety reasons."
"EVERYTHING IS GREAT"
"EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!"
"Everything was well-maintained."
"Excellent approach road and parking. Walking trails in first class condition."
"Excellent park guides and viewing areas."
"Excellent place to fish!!"
"Exit is difficult as traffic speeds toward you from bridge!"
"Experience limited to visitor center and drive to and from volunteer trail maintenence site. This is 1% of the refuge other than the visitor center. Think highly of the v.ctr."
"Fantastic refuge... my new favorite place in Ohio! Perfect spot for birding and helpful rangers!!"
"Fantastic visitor center, nice boardwalk"
"First off, I was at the boat marina. Not part of the refuge, the refuge is the island."
"First time visits to new parks and boat launches can be tricky. In my experience it can near impossible to locate acceptable street addresses to input into a GPS, or waze style app for turn by turn directions. At times this can be quite frustrating. Somehomework for you, just using only google how long does it take you to find a street address for a park you have never been to :) Thanks for this survey and all the hard work of the teams. The interns I met at my boat launch were filled with hope and great!"
"First visit to refuge discovering it as we drove back to hotel from beach. Impressed with the refuge and plan on making it a planned stop next time we visit Delaware from home in Maryland."
"Fished by old bridge on irish bayou the intracne exit from hwy11/i10 is dangerious bad drop off when pulling off road and when pulling back on road u can't see oncoming traffic due to bushs needs to be cur"
"FISHING DOCKS, OTHER THAN BOAT RAMPS"
"Fix the pot holes please."
"fix the road"
"For better access for people with disabilities a paved part of the trail from the parking area and visitor center to say Bench #1 would be scenic and much more accessible."
"For bird-watchers in cars, pull-off areas are very important. This allows us to patiently watch birds or wait for them to arrive. Meanwhile, other cars may pass without inconvenience to either party."
"For the final item above accessibility I marked not at all important for me personally since I am able bodied, but I do not think public lands should be accessible for all."
"Frequently run with baby stroller. Roads are well paved, wide. Very nice."
"From the south boat launch area, near Clarendon. The canal needs to be re erected from the boat launch to the main channel of Rock Roe. To have this access only during times of flooding or by ATV roads. Does not help those with disabilities get the proper access for waterfowl hunting."
"Getting in and out of entrance to refuge from highway is very challenging during afternoon commuter hours; lacks adequate signage on trails & non-motorized roads, needed to rely on kiosk map for bearings the first few visits to refuge."
"Getting there is easy. Leaving to go east can be very difficult."
"Given the short distance of the access road and the small size of the parking area, could use paving. The parking lot can fill up easily on weekends, prompting people to park along the access road."
"GOING OVER THE SPILLWAYS COULD BE BETTER AND POTHOLES."
"GOOD SIGNAGE FOR BUSES, MOTOR BIKE/CYCLES, AND AUXILLARY PARKING ON HEAVY BIRDING DAYS (SNOWY OWL & RAZORBILLS)"
"Good work"
"Google maps missed our exit! Would have taken us (coming from the South) way to the north for miles, to a different exit, then backtracked. If we hadn't seen the sign for the exit at the last minute we would have wasted a lot of time."
"Grass is overgrown in the center of certain stretches of trail, makes it difficult to walk through."
"GRAVEL PARKING LOT HAS MANY POT HOLES"
"Gravel road and parking conditions are poor! Pot holes holding water, poor drainage."
"gravel road going north of Blue Mound Cemetery has washboard surface;needs grading"
"Gravel roads and dirt paths in this park are appropriate and well kept, but may limit wheel chair access."
"Graveled road creates WAY TOO MUCH dust from vehicles; choking out hikers, walkers & plant life. Folks do not obey speed limit. Lots of pot holes year around. Trails used to be maintained much better; lately not so much. Feels kinda creepy walking among such tall weeds and hanging overhead growth."
"Great easy access to waterways with well-maintained boat ramps and good roadways to get to the boat ramps. Plenty of parking nearby."
"Great meadows is a killer place. The signage on rt 62 could be a little more pronounced but other than that, I think it's excellent and maintained very well."
"Great place but limited to only one large pond/lake view."
"Great place to visit!"
"Great resource and should be kept open for the community. As the population in Ridgefield grows there will need to be additional attention paid to the pressure from human populations on the reserve."
"Great safe place for long runs 16 - 20+ miles"
"Guam was amazing"
"HANDICAPPED SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE ATV ON ROADS"
"Hard to access from the highway. Needed to make a u-turn up the road to get into the correct direction home."
"Hard to remember stuff a couple weeks later."
"have begun to let disabled use seats at refuge and some parts cana be pushed on W/C, has some benches"
"Having more pull outs would be extremely helpful. If I see a bird on the side of the road, it's hard to find a good spot to pull over, even in places that seem like a lot of people would want to stop (the road to Broadkill Beach, for example)."
"Having more wheelchair accessible areas (paved, not gravel) would be ideal so I can bring my friends who use manual wheelchairs along with me to the refuge."
"Heavy flooding at Haberman NWR has washed out one road completely. I don't know if it will be repaired. I observed a lot of work to restore and reopen roads and the Big Mineral parking lot during my visit."
"Heinz needs to update their trail signs."
"Hi! Some guidebooks listed the Okelehao Trail as an easy hiking trail. Several listed it as challenging. It was challenging. There was a substantial climb, ropes, etc. I was not fully prepared for the mud and incline. Made it up and back but fell about a dozen times...the park's attempts to lay down mesh and other material to hold up the slopes has been mostly stripped away.  So, hiker signage might be helpful - hopefully this is transportation-related and relevant.  Thanks!"
"HIGH WINDS FORCED US TO EVACUTE THE MARSH THIS SPRING. IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO NOTIFY EVERYBODY. WE HAD TO DRIVE THROUGH ONE DEEP WATER TO GET OUT."
"HIKERS AND JOGGERS SHOULD HAVE TO HOLD A SIGNED PAMPHLET LIKE HUNTERS SO THEY KNOW THE RULES, AND REGULATIONS, WHERE HUNTING IS PERMITTED SO THEY DO NOT HARASS HUNTERS OR BRING DOGS IN WOODS NEAR HUNTERS"
"Horseback is a low priority at this facility - it would be a valuable addition! Hunting/fishing is a low priority to me"
"Horses ruin trails for hikers!"
"I'd like to have access to more trails/boardwalks to explore the bayous on foot in addition to by kayak."
"I'd like to see a couple lane ways plowed in the fields for people who have difficulty walking that would still like to hunt their dogs. Thank you for asking me to complete this survey!"
"I'd like to see the road getting down to the refuge to be graded more regularly. The road in the refuge could use more grading as well in certain areas."
"I'm not sure about my answers. I don't have a clear memory of road conditions. I think the entry road is narrow. The sign for the park is small. I'm afraid I'll miss it. I haven't walked around the whole park or used the large network of trails recently."
"I'VE HEARD THAT BLACKWATER IS A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR BIKERS. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON BIKE LANES/TRAVEL."
"I've often thought that foot travel on the main refuge is overly prohibited. Many of the access roads into the main part of the refuge are signed for no access to public. While I understand the need to give wildlife it's space I've seen less restricted access to wildlife areas in many national parks. If all I'm doing is walking into an area to photograph the wildlife I can't believe that my presence is much of disruption during off migration times of the year."
"I'VE ONLY TOOK MY MOTORCYCLE HERE, BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF PARKING FOR CARS, AND I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THE BUS GOES RIGHT TO THE REFUGE."
"I've visited Ottawa NWR several times and always have a good experience. This was the first time I've been in the visitor center: it's very nice."
"I absolutely had a great time. The boat ride was the best part. :)"
"I acknowledge that funds are extremely limited for the creation & maintenance of trails. I respect that this land is a wildlife refuge, but trails within these thousands of acres are essentially non existant."
"I always run to the refuge from my house so transportation is a no factor for me."
"I AM GLAD THE TRAIN CROSSING SITUATION IS TO BE IMPROVED. THE BRIDGE COMING IN/OUT OVER SLOUGH IS TERRIFYING."
"I am old but able bodied. I wish I could direct people that are restricted to wheelchairs to see this and other WVa wildlife areas."
"I am pleased with the handicap access"
"I am surpringly pleased at the efficiency of the park-and-ride shuttle service available during the annual bird festival.  Pedestrian access trails from the neighborhoods to the south would be a great addition."
"i am unsure of what the meaning of this question is --- i do not support widening of roads or larger parking lots for cars."
"I answered 25 minutes time to arrive at the refuge but that is walking time not driving. If I drove to the refuge (one only a few times when I was limited by time) it would only take approximately 12 minutes."
"I appreciate that the driving trail was still open after the special birding event since we had to visit after the special event."
"I ARRIVED AND SAW ONLY 1 LOOP TRAIL NEAR THE LONG HOUSE. A SECOND TRAIL WAS CLOSED."
"I believe access for the difficult walking should be at the more convenvient refuge's across the board. I guess I would like to see it not have to take up swamps and alot of fields to provide roads and trails."
"I brought a bus and a van with a total of 36 seniors and 2 drivers. We had no problem getting around on the loop or walking the boardwalk"
"I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY I'VE USED MORE THAN BOAT LAUNCH TO CANE BAYOU - PARKING LOT IS FINE, SIGNAGE COULD BE BETTER."
"I can see my tax dollars at work on this refuge"
"I consider this refuge to be PERFECT! No need to change anything, and definitely don't ""improve"" anything."
"I DID NOT ANSWER ON THE RIGHT THOSE AREAS I DID NOT ACCESS."
"I DIDN'T DRIVE - WE RODE IN A VAN PROVIDED BY TOUR COMPANY. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY ISSUES. WHICH MEANS CONDITIONS WERE ACCEPTABLE."
"I DIDN'T SEE MANY WAY FINDING SIGNS ON THE TRAIL. THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL"
"I do not have any."
"I do not want to see additional roads or parking lots be created. I do not want to see impacts to habitat for that. However, it's a good thing to keep the current roads in decent shape to drive or walk on."
"I DON'T LIKE THIS TYPE OF SURVEY QUESTION"
"I enjoy the auto route! Lots of habitat and nice trails spread throughout!"
"I feel they are well kept up and in good repair. They are doing a good job."
"I felt the surface condition of the roads was horrible, however, I was ""slightly satisfied"" with the unique experience of driving on them. It is likely I would have visited additional areas of the refuge and st"
"I FIND THAT WILD AREAS MADE ACCESSIBLE ARE OFTEN RUINED TO MY TASTES. I DON'T WANT TO WALK ON ASPHALT OR 3/4 MINUS GRAVEL. I GO INTO NATURE LOOKING FOR JUST A DIRT TRAIL, AND LEAVE THE REST BEHIND. MAYBE A SHORTER, SEPARATE AREA LIKE THEY PAVED ON THE SOUTH, GORGE SIDE OF CATHERINE CREEK NEAR LYLE."
"I found everything that pertained to my trip to be as good or better than most places I fish throughout the year."
"I FOUND NEW PLACES TO VISIT ON MY SECOND VISIT BECAUSE OF EXCELLENT SIGNAGE. ENTRY WAY TO THE REFUGE NEEDS REPAIRING."
"I frequently use the small wayside parking lot off of Roy Rogers Rd. The turn is not particularly well marked and it is difficult to see if another vehicle is approaching. A refuge turn lane and sign marking the wildlife area would improve safety."
"I go to The wild life refuge to observe animals (and take photos). Screaming kids, kids making monster noises etc. directly effect the experience of people like me. Noisy children also scare the animals. It's a wild life refuge! NOT a park. Refuge employees and volunteers should do more to ask people to respect the wild life and respect people who ant a peaceful experience."
"I greatly look forward to visiting the Loess Bluffs National Wildlife Refuge at least once a year, particularly in December to see trumpeter swans, snow geese and bald eagles. It is extremely frustrating that the office and shop are closed on weekends.The weekly waterfowl count should be posted at least through December. The last one this year was Dec. 4. The bottom step of the observation deck between Eagle Pool and Pelican Pool was broken when we visited Dec. 15. This is a safety hazard."
"I grew up in Frankenmuth and visit this refuge when I visit, but I don't like that the refuge doesn't open until June 1st. I think opening the refuge road earlier in the spring would allow me to enjoy it over the Memorial holidays."
"I had no idea we were on the refuge until we pulled over to take a selfie. There were people there (I thought they were fishing) that took our picture and told us about the refuge."
"I had to park quite a ways up the road, but at there was parking there."
"I HATE WHEN THEY CLOSE IN THE FALL FOR THE HUNTERS"
"I Have a real good time for my life. I turly appreciate you all!"
"I have been at this place at least 10 times over the last 30 years love the view and the wildlife and the hike"
"I have Deer hunted the Refuge for over 20 years. The cattle fences are a disruption to climb over or under. Snow plow trucks show no concern for vehicles parked along refuge roads and will plow heavy wet snow on anyone standing to close to the road or bythe vehicles. They will often break off your mirrors. I personally was hit by the snow from a snow plow while hunting and could have been seriously injured. 2017.  I filed a complaint with the County. I have also seen photos of deer caught in the barbwire fence that have died hanging from the fence. There is not enough cattle in the State to eat all the vegetation available on the refuge. Dead and fallen trees litter the oak forests and should be cleaned up. Wood cutting permits could be available so the general public could help with this matter in all areas of the refuge. Bow hunters should be required to register as proof deer killed and taken by them personally on the Refuge so they do not come back and gun hunt deer as well. The Refuge Restrooms byBlue hill indicate no hunters. Hunters pay taxes and should not be restricted from using them. We as deer hunters are not allowed to use roads on the Refuge during hunting season. Animals killed have to be dragged or carted out a mile or better in some cases. The refuge is a fine and changeling place to deer hunt. Please continue to make it better for all to use.  Thanks!"
"I HAVE DIFFICULTY WALKING (RECENT HIP REPLACEMENT). A STEP IS NECESSARY TO GET ON THE TRAM (IS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE9. GOLF CART BATTERIES NOT ALWAYS CHARGED - GOLF CARTS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE. WOULD LIKE TO VISIT CEDAQR POINT REFUGE IN MY OWN CAR (FOLLOWING IS OK BUT NOT ALLOWED). YOUR BUS SEATS ARE TOO SMALL FOR MY SISTER AND I AND THE STEPS ARE STEEP."
"I have difficulty walking. More benches along hiking trails, please!"
"I have heard that a new access road is being planned. That would be great."
"I have none."
"I have not had the need to consider how people who are wheel chair bound may be able to access this wonderful site. The gravel walk way is fine for biking and walking, but perhaps for those with mobility issues, you may want to include a paved walk way.It is such a beautiful site and would be wonderful to open to all."
"I HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED HAVE SERVERAL PLACES ALONG THE DRIVE THRU WHERE THE WEEDS ARE CUT TO ALLOW VISITORS TO BETTER SEE ANIMALS E.G. EVERY 1/4 TO 1/2 MILE CUT A 15-20 FT WIDE OPENING TO ALLOW VISITORS TO WALK INTO THE FIELDS - MORE IMPORTANT TOWARDTHE END OF SUMMER WHEN WEEDS ARE 3-5 FT TALL"
"I JUST LOVE THE NEW PAVED ROAD IN FROM THE MAIN, IT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE. ESP FOR ME ON MY MOTORCYCLE FULL TIME THAT DIRT ROAD WOULD OF STOPPED ME. GLAD I'M ABLE TO KEEP VISITING. THANKS"
"I know it's a refuge and therefore needs to be less developed but the road into the refuge should be a little wider. I wish the service vehicles which run out to the spit could use a clean fuel rather than gas."
"I know that it's a chance we take, but we've gone there after a heavy rain and the road was flooded and, therefore, impassable. I think one way to handle this would be to post updates somewhere (website, facebook, etc) where visitors can know whether or not they will be able to access the fishing area."
"I like that there are no cars allowed in refuge. It does make it difficult for people with disabilities though to be able to experience the refuge."
"I like the people/volunteers manning the Visitor Center. They are very helpful. The butterfly garden was large and beautiful this year. The roads were damaged by recent flooding, thus were bumpy. We are ""Friends of Hagerman"" and members of the Hagerman Photo Club."
"I like the tram tour offer. Good and informed way to visit the refuge"
"I live about one mile from this refuge and I am out there almost every day. I really enjoy it"
"I live five minutes away. I come everyday to run."
"I LOVE GOING THROUGH THIS WILDLIFE REFUGE - THIS IS SO IMPORTANT- OUR CHILDREN NEED THIS"
"I LOVE TAKING MY GRANDCHILDREN THERE TO OBSERVE THE WILDLIFE ON SCOOTERS AND/OR BIKES."
"I love that the rough roads keep attendance rates down. The solitude at DNWR is the reason we go."
"I LOVE THAT THE TRAIL IS MOSTLY WALKER FRIENDLY FOR THOSE WHO NEED EXTRA ASSISTANCE HOWEVER, THERE IS A RATHER RUFF UNPAVED PART TO GET OUT TOWARDS THE TIDAL PART OF THE BOARDWALK."
"I love the refuge. However, it needs to do a better job of trail maintenance as well as building connecting trails to surrounding public lands. More bicycle trails are very much needed. Our local economy is completely dependent on recreation and we need the refuge to build more trails, including bike trails, to support that. Thank you."
"I love to fish & you have plenty! Thank you very much for all that you do."
"I miss the original dyke paths - provided wider expanse of view"
"i miss the turnoff & end up in Ridgefield downtown... every trip."
"I REALLY LIKE THAT THERE ARE NOT CARS ON THE REFUGE - ONLY AT PARKING AREA"
"I ride my bike from a local part into this refuge"
"I think for this refuge the under brush has taken over. You use to be able to see the river on the back side of island while walking but cant any longer because of brush.  I think people drive to fast and there is n place for handicap people ."
"I think it would be hard for a person with a wheelchair or walker, but I'm against adding asphalt to the refuge as it has a negative environmental impact. Plus there is some access already for handicapped individuals."
"I think it would be nice if they had a golf cart rental for people with mobility issues."
"I THINK MORE PULL-OFFS ARE IMPORTANT. BIRDERS TEND TO GO SLOWLY OTHERS NOT SO MUCH"
"I think that the Avenza maps used at Dale Bumpers white river National wildlife refuge is something all refuge needs. You will always know where your at."
"I think the roads could have more gravel and signs could be posted in more places so that people don't get on the wrong wma"
"I think the signs leading the the camping islands could be improved. We arrived at Floyd's island our first night and there was no sign, we only knew we were in the right place by the cabin. We never found Mixom's hammock for our second night camping."
"I think the speed limit should be reduced and speed limit signs should be posted."
"I THINK THE TRAILS AND THE ACTUAL CENTER COULD BE MORE IDENTIFIED FOR PEOPLE TAVELING FROM OUT OF THE AREA."
"i think they should make the road all the way around the island s that you could see more from your car"
"I think you need to not worry about transportation-related issues"
"I travelled the access roads on a motorcycle"
"I used the refuge frequently when I was a student at Mississippi State University in the mid 1980s'. It was good to see the many improvements and upgrades since then. During my visit the refuge appeared to have received recent heavy rains and several ofthe trails we were going to try were underwater or to wet to hike."
"I visit this refuge quite often as relaxation and I am never dissatisfied. If conditions are not safe, I have been instructed to leave the refuge by employees for safety reasons. (Ice for example) Always a variety of wildlife and scenery that never disappoints. I try promoting this refuge on Facebook with my photos (DES Wildlife Photos) and have interested people from Indiana to Oklahoma that visit now by following my page."
"I volunteer with physically challenged people (strokes, Parkinsons...) and I thought that Pinkney was most suitable for those that I have contact."
"I was amazed at how many people were here on the day I visited, parking lot nearly 1/3-1/2 full and it was cold, foggy and raining, nearly time to close, yet fairly full. With it nearing sundown and time of closure, I was unsure the amount of MINUTES of astandard walk to return to the parking lot. One visitor out there was nearly running, saying it would close and getting dark, but I was going the other way around the loop, unsure how long rest of loop was."
"I was happy to see that the light house was back to it's original glory."
"I was riding a motorcycle, road condition was very important"
"I was very pleased that the refuge is highly accessible to pedestrians, residents who live near the refuge, and via public transportation."
"I wasn't paying close attention to this but my general impression was very favorable -- well marked from the highway, easy to find, easy to park (although we were there on a not-crowded day), easy to find and walk the excellent trail."
"I went on the wildlife drive last year and there seemed to be very limited places to pull over. Maybe this is by design as there may be a worry people would wander around on foot and disrupt the wildlife, but it really takes away from the experience. I feel rushed through an area if someone is behind me because I do not want to hold up traffic on a 1-lane/1-way road.   Other than the difficulties of limited places to stop on1-way wildlife drive, I will say that I will usually have a more productive daydriving 2 hours each way to Lake Erie than I would have had in that same amount of time locally in Fort Wayne."
"I went to the visitors center and just stayed in the very close nearby trails."
"I wish I could have spent more time on the lovely trail, but my knee was not cooperating."
"I wish the barricade could be opened once a month for birders going to Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. Some of our elderly birders are unable to walk the 1-2 miles on the shell road to the end. Just a suggestion!"
"I WISH THE BRUSHES/BRUSH WAS CUT BACK A LITTLE ON THE TRAILS. MY FRIEND HAD A TICK ON HER AFTER A WALK AND THOUGH I KNOW ITS NATURE BUT IT WAS A CONCERN."
"I wish the surface of the berm was smoother so that I could comfortably ride my bike on it."
"I wish there was a better overall map of the refuge available for purchase --showing trails and roads and indicating which are public access, etc. There is one map available of which I am aware and it is not a good one.   Some signage is inaccurate. Oneglaring example is a 3-sided sign which states 3 difference ""distances"" for a nearby city ---varying between 14 and 16 miles depending on which side of the sign you are on :)"
"I wish there were more accessible hiking opportunities"
"I WORRY ABOUT CARE THEFT. CARS BLOCK SIGHT OF NATURE CENTER EMPLOYEES. NO SECURITY OR OBSERVATION"
"I WOULD LIKE MORE SPOTS TO PULL OVER ON AUTO TRAIL"
"I would like that the refuge in New Johnsonville would have more than one entrance!!!"
"I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE PAVED ROADS SAFER FOR BICYCLES"
"I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN WITH MOUNTAIN BIKES BUT AM A BIT CONCERNED BECAUSE BIKES & MOTORIZED VEHICKLES HARE A NARROW 1-WAY LOOP WITH FEW AREAS TO PULL OVER. NOT A PROBLEM IF FEW VISITORS."
"I would like to see a little more attention given to the roads and trails for drainage and ditches."
"I would like to see a more detailed trail map."
"I would like to see another long drive to a different area in the park!"
"I WOULD LOVE TO RUN/JOG IN THE REFUGE. PUTTING IN GRAVEL OR PAVED TRAILS WOULD BE GREAT. INSTEAD OF MOWED DOWN PATHWAYS THAT ARE HARD TO USE"
"I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE WHEEL CHAIR ACCESSIBILITY"
"Icy conditions are not well-maintained on black roads. We have slid off the roads into ditches."
"If one could not walk long distance many areas were not accessible. Since we were on a bike, distance to other trails was less important. Volunteers shuttle would be a positive solution. I think we saw one at on"
"If the refuge continues to gain popularity as it has over the last few years, additional parking and trails should be added."
"IF you can control speed limits by posting sign, Than you should be responsible for road condition like pot holes!!!!"
"important work, tks"
"IN BAD WEATHER IS IF ROADS ARE SAFE, WE WILL VISIT"
"In reference to the auto tour loop at Ridgefield NWR, the gravel road is pretty good. However, The gravel road that takes to the loop itself is super rough. I'm only mentioning it because the rest of the loop is very smooth, so I wonder why the access road would be so much worse. Thanks."
"IN RWB DISTRICT, I PRIMARILY PARK ON GRAVEL ROADS ADJACENT TO WPA'S - ACCEES IS GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD DUE TO LANDSCPAE. ALSO USE PARKING AREAS ON WPA'S FROM TIME TO TIME WHICE ARE NICE, ESPECIALLY WHEN AREA IS NEXT TO BUSY ROAD/INTERSECTION & SAFER FOR LOADING/UNLOADING DOGS"
"In the Carty Lake Unit, several of the trails have not been maintained this year. One part of the trail remains blocked from a fallen tree from approx six months ago. Also, the seasonal extension of the Oaks-to-wetlands loop has not been maintained in _years_ and is now almost completely invisible and impassbly overgrown. Part of the Carty Lake trail (after the bridge) that should have been opened on May 1st, is still blocked off for some reason."
"Invasive plants (cat tails and chinese water lilly) have become dominant eliminating habitat for migratory ducks and other birds, the main attraction of this refuge. The refuge employees claim this is to protect the Branding Turtle but I don't believe it"
"It's a beautiful place and deserves protection and preservation."
"It's a long walk for the elderly and people with disabilities to see the birds. I recommend a closer parking lot, or either a drive through the bird area."
"It's a trail in a wildlife refuge, it should NOT need to be larger or paved. It is charming and adequate just the way it is."
"It's easy to get lost on the Ridge/Cliff side of the trail. The map in the brochure was not accurate about where to go, or how far to go to the next trail intersection/path. There were no clear signs posted on the path to match the trail features drawn on the map. We had to backtrack, then repeat the path and walk further than expected in order to find the Ridgeline path. The brochure map was not detailed enough."
"It's important to keep the grass very trimmed (or weed whacked) on the main walkway because of ticks. There are some patches of tall grass along the main walking assess road, someone should be maintaining that better since it is a public health issue. Thanks!"
"It's very difficult to know where the boundaries of the park are along 1431 and what you might experience if you explore areas. Signage for parking areas was excellent."
"It can be dangerous getting out of the Refuge Area and turning left during heavy traffic that is exiting Hilton Head Island. A stoplight might need to added at a later date at that main entrance."
"It had rained recently which may account for poor road conditions."
"It is a great place to visit for many purposes. Keep up the good work."
"It is a nice refuge and we appreciate finding it while on a beach trip"
"IT IS A PLEASANT PLACE TO WALK IN THE TOWN WE LIVE IN."
"It is a remote area designed as a refuge. Access/use should be constrained."
"It is a very well kept area. More parking would be helpful during peak times."
"IT IS CAR TOUR SO MANY OF THE FEATURES ARE UNRELATED TO GETTING AROUND IN THE REFUGE"
"It is difficult to find the entrance off the road in the suburban cul-de-sac"
"It is extremely hard to enter and exit this landing due to the constant flow of traffic on the bridges."
"It is hard to fish most spots due to lack of parking. Refuge is about the only place to fish from the shore nowadays. Most good fishing spots on lake have been closed off."
"It is hell driving on the first section of road. If this section was better, I would visit more often."
"It is helpful to have places for cars to pull over so faster vehicles can go around them"
"It is nice to have a separate entrance and exit. I have never seen the parking lot full which is nice."
"It is quite common to be following another car, sometimes even quite closely, while the other driver fails to pull over, passing several pullover spots obliviously. Sometimes with 2-3 cars behind. Signage addressing this situation could be helpful."
"It is rough terrain. The roads are minimally graded but still passable. Keeps nature as undisturbed as possible."
"It is sometimes muddy in the spring, after the ground thaws and when the water is high."
"It is too small a refuge to have real transport-related features!"
"It is very easy to miss the sign marking the turnoff from the main road. Signs giving distance to turn off on either side of it would be helpful."
"It looks as though at this time work is in progress and should enhance the refuge."
"It was a wonderful experience, hoping to come back soon!"
"It was difficult to find the refuge location. No signage in neighboring area indicating its location."
"It was lovely site, we were happy to have found it. Thank you."
"It was nice for not being really busy with traffic"
"It was nice to have a person directing us to an available parking space."
"It was somewhat confusing figuring out where to enter the refuge, the two entrances were called different things eg west gate vs the state park and wasn't sure where we were supposed to go"
"IT WOULD BE GREAT IF DISTANCES WERE LISTED ON TRAIL SIGNS."
"It would be great if there were better roads / trails to ride a bicycle. Riding on the loose gravel roads can be tricky."
"It would be great if there were more turnouts long the main road to stop and park. Just small spaces to pull of the road that could accommodate two cars. That would allow visitors to walk along the road and enjoy the greenery and river views.  Some additional signage describing foliage or history at points along the road would be nice too. My main purpose when I visit the refuge is walking with my dogs on the trails or main road. Thanks!"
"It would be great if they would rent bicycle at the entrance, so that you get around the entire island more easily."
"It would be great if walking path was longer. hcod unsafe to walk with dog on bike path after walking path ends. I like the place a lot though."
"It would be lovely to offer a mid morning and mid afternoon limited seating tour with ""higher up"" seating, say a van that was higher up off the ground than my low subaru wagon. Ridgefield's unique driving tour is wonderful. If a person has a high enough vehicle, water areas can be seen on both sides of the windows. With a tour guide, someone who knows a bit of the history, the bird areas, bird identification etc. Volunteers may be willing to host this would be especially nice for elderly, and evenhome school children. Perhaps volunteers could work on a fund raiser to purchase the van land the refuge could fund the insurance with some pay back as available by donations from the riders."
"IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO THE REFUGE"
"It would be nice to see mile markers on the trails"
"It would be nice to see the gravel roads within the refuges get a good grading from time to time. That seems to never get done, and it is one of the easiest possible tasks."
"IT WOULD BE NICE TO WIDEN ROAD BY MAYBE A FOOT ON EACH SIDE."
"Its easy to get lost on the canal digger trail. It needs a better surface and marking."
"Its extremely important to keep the boat ramps and parking areas maintained to help keep anglers coming in which helps with the local economies"
"JUST KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"
"Keep it open"
"Keep up the good work!"
"Keep wildlife drive open in the winter."
"LAKE ROAD IS A MESS AND IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG FOR THEM TO FIX IT. PUT UP A LIGHT OVER LAUNCH SO WE CAN SEE IT. NOT SAFE! PUT UP SIGNS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW NOT TO PARK IN LAUNCH OR CRAB OFF OF DOCK. THEN START WRITING THEM TICKETS."
"Large sized gravel makes biking walking more difficult"
"Lee road main entrance need boat docks for 3 ramps windy conditions cause problems and safety concern"
"left turn exit out of boat launch nearly impossible during rush hour traffic morning and evening. Left turn into boat launch during morning rush hours also impossible and dangerous. Need to build entrance and exit road off entrance to the wildlife areapassing east of second bridge to Hilton Head island."
"let's keep making a huge effort to help save the Kauai endemic birds! Well, let's help save all hawaiian bird species!"
"LET US CAMP."
"Liked the one-way driving loop; much safer than two-way."
"Limited parking here."
"Local people often use tour road as a short cut, gettin from one highway (east side) To north highway. Normally ignoring reasonable speed for area."
"Locals done at very high rate of speeds on refuge roads not very safe!"
"LOS LETREROS CASI NO SEVEN NE SESITAN ESTAR MAS GRANDES."
"Lost time went to desert NWR, the road in was not paved now it is, and it made a big difference."
"Lots of nutria present"
"love this place!!"
"Love this refuge. Very beautiful scenery and the vistors center was very helpful."
"MAIN DRIVING TRAIL NOT OPEN"
"MAIN ENTRANCE IS NOT SAFE - NEEDS TO BE WIDER."
"MAINLY JUST HAPPENED ACROSS IT BY ACCIDENT WHILE OUT RIDING OUR MOTORCYCLE, VERY HAPPY FIND! TOOK MY MOM BACK AT LATER DATE IN CAR SHE LOVED IT."
"MAINTENANCE OF ACCESS ROADS TO BOAT RAMPS NEED BETTER ATTENTION."
"Make the signs bigger and more legible. More parking spots, and level walking surfaces for this with mobility issues.   Great refuge for birds - market more as something to do while in Kauai."
"Many folds ride bikes at PINWR please take into account when the trail roads are refilled with gravel sometimes its too loose in spots for bikes."
"Many roads show up on the map as usable, and when biked there were intermittent large holes. I hit a hole with my bike and flew over handlebars. Mark as bikeable or not so people dont get hurt. Many roads ground up for firebreak, which is a huge drawback for people who want to go into different areas. Do you have to grind up these roads until they are a sandy beach, or could they still be hard and usable after firebreak is done?"
"Maps and signage could be improved, i.e. better correspondence between the two."
"Marked clearly and parking availability"
"Marked down a bit for parking pull offs in refuge, mainly when it is busy. Want to get a picture but have a line of cars behind you sometimes and wind up missing some great shots or even just to see and show the kids something."
"May be have periodic signs to remind people to pull well over for others to be able to pass by? (Some get it, some are clueless. Maybe signs wouldn't help the latter.)"
"MAYBE PUT A SHORT RAIL LIKE ONES IN A CAR WASH TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING OFF EDGE OF OVERPASS?"
"Money is needed to maintain trails. Trails making loops and connecting with other public lands trails need to be one of the priorities."
"More access into areas by vehicle since walking and standing is difficult to do! Motorized carts or wheelchairs or assistance of any kind to assist in enjoying the entire park and nature center! I love visiting this refuge!"
"MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED IN KEEPING THAT PORTION OF THE TRAIL WHICH RUNS PARALLEL TO I-95 FROM BECOMING OVERGROWN"
"MORE BIKING TRAILS, MORE FISHING ACCESS TRAILS"
"More law enforcement presence. Motorized vehicles seem to go above the speed limit"
"MORE MAPS ALONG THE TRAIL WOULD BE HELPFUL. THERE ARE A COUPLE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GO ONE WAY FOR A LONGER ROUTE OR ANOTHER WAY FOR SHORTER ROUTE AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE A MAP."
"More non-motorized opportunities. Improved safety for cyclist and pedestrians."
"More parking is needed. People park on the nearby neighborhood streets when full and I'm sure neighbors find it tiresome. Also the access road is narrow -- barely enough space for 2 cars to pass."
"More parking is needed. The total distance of walking both trails might be nice."
"More parking pullovers next to grain fields. Bike lanes on Pigeon Creek & North Wolf Creek Rd"
"More parking spaces. I have visited this refuge 3 times oevr the years- first time it was open. Only during summer."
"More photo blinds would be nice. Wheeler NWR has a photo blind that is only available by reservation from the park superintendent. Something that would allow limited access to the areas that would normally be off-limits during the migration season. I realize the Pintail Point Observation deck can serve as a photo blind, but I haven't had much success with it."
"More pull-out areas along the auto tour route would be appreciated."
"MORE PULL OFFS FOR VIEWING WILDLIFE"
"More roads, trails"
"MORE ROOM FOR PULL OFFS ALONG WILDLIFE LOOP THAT EASILY ALLOW CARS TO GET AROUND"
"More signs off freeway would be helpful for people unfamiliar with the area."
"More trail signs would be helpful."
"MORE TURNOUTS NEEDED"
"Most people that come to the refuge are respectful of the roadways and wildlife, but this year I have noticed damage on the drive from vehicles doing burn-outs on the drive and donuts in the parking areas. I personally witnessed a male in a teal pickup after passing me go down the drive about 300 feet and then stop and peel out creating a large dust cloud and sending dirt and gravel flying. This is deplorable behavior. I took a picture but the dust cloud obscured his license plate."
"Most refuge roads are not accessible to cars"
"much better than germany"
"Much of the access to this refuge is along public roads. Creating and maintaining larger and safer pull-offs would be very helpful to refuge visitors and for the public using these roads and have to deal with refuge visitors."
"Mud, lots and lots of mud"
"My concerns about safety on the refuge are mostly about the other drivers, who use the auto tour as a short cut and drive very fast - as well as the people employed by General Dynamics who may be in a hurry to get to work there."
"My daughter and I love coming to this refuge. We always see something we haven't seen before. The last time we came, when we were asked about the survey, the road on the east side needed gravel badly. It was very muddy. Thank you and keep up the good work!"
"My family and I LOVE comming to this refugee."
"My family has been visiting Sachuest Point in Middletown sine 1984; seen changes in making walking trails wider/better;that's fine but don't want the next step to be paved trails! Love our sachuest point!"
"My family loves going to the refuge."
"My father, who visited once before bringing his grandchildren and myself there, tried to take a road and said it was undrivable, never ending dirt road, bouncing them around, unpaved and he never got to his destination. He was disappointed and said don'tever take that road."
"My husband is disabled so we really enjoyed and appreciated the ability for us to have access to the drivable nature trail in the south side of the refuge."
"My last visit was unusual in the sense every parking space was taken. First time in several years."
"My wife and nine year old son and I stopped here to enjoy a short walk on a nice evening while my 11 year old daughter was in dance at the local high school. It was recommending to us by some family friends. We enjoyed it very much and will certainly beback to explore some more."

"Not enough parking by a long shot. If the trail was wider, couple could pass, going in opposite directions"
"not enough parking spaces for amount of visitors, i get there early and its fine but when i leave there are cars parked all over, along the road and in the grass around the parking spots"
"Not enough space for buses of people on weekends in parking area"
"Not enough walking trails some trails closed for over a year"
"Not much for bicycling except roads. Could use a bicycle map."
"Not much improvement can be done. Place is very well maintained. Impressively so."
"not near enough parking"
"Not sure if we enter this refuge at the correct entrance, but there was no visitor's center or parking area. Very limited parking near a retail bike shop."
"Not sure this falls under transportation, but would like to see a managed hiking trail for the summer months and less commerciallization of the fields. This last trip was the first time in quite some time that I've seen the fields flooded for wildlife asthey should be."
"Not that I would consider it a transportation-related feature, but I feel that there is total over-kill on signs designating wildlife refuge lands almost to the point of ridiculousness in several places near where I live."
"Not the most well marked sign for the road you turn on to get to the refuge entrance"
"Nothing to comment"
"Now I know why the roads are frequently flooded and thus closed preventing my visiting."
"Okefenokee in folkston and way cross are wonderful"
"On of the walk bridge was not well maintained."
"ON OUR SECOND VISIT WE USED THE BACK ENTRANCE WHICH WAS HARD TO FIND AND DIFFICULT IF TURNING ACROSS TRAFFIC"
"On the drive through area the entrance road should be paved."
"once turned off highway to get to Magee Marsh, there were no directions on where to go. I had to ask someone along the road for directions."
"One could wish the Wildlife Drive were open more often, though of course the animals take precedence."
"ONE LANE BRIDGE ON A SLIGHT HILL MADE IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE IF ONCOMING CARS WERE APPROACHING."
"ONE LANE ROIAD THRU REFUGE"
"one muddy, pot holed rough spot on road just inside entrance to refuge but before entering gates to visitors center"
"one road was paved and a place to pull off was not leaving a drop off. no ware to park. it was a way to get to fishing and forging."
"Ongoing projects restoring the natural habitat is fantastic! One specific note on this - please consider trail coverings that do not get kicked up into shoes and stuck in treads (it would be a great advantage for users/visitors).   Vandalism and misuse are rampant damaging this amazing natural resource as. Responsible authorities need to engage problematic parties in meaningful ways  - educating unintentional damage and dissuading vandalism.  Forest services drive by in there vehicles, individualsare not engages - this is not working!"
"ONLY CONCERN IS TIDAL FLOODING THAT IS OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY ON SOME REFUGE ROADS AND TRAILS."
"ONLY MAJOR ISSUE IS THE SPEED AT WHICH PEOPLE DRIVE."
"Only one way in or out. Have gate but they keep it locked."
"ONWR IS WELL MANAGED AND RUN. I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY THAT THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE POND AREAS OPEN FOR BIRDERS AND OTHER VISITORS"
"Other than the gravel road in can get rutted and at times, there is not enough parking, in general I think the refuge is well maintained and easy to use. I would say the same about the Ridgefield NWR which I also visit multiple times a year. Love having these places available for my walking/photography activities."
"Our visit was to the Kilauea Point lighthouse. Flocks of tourists. No way could they let everyone in at one time so we were allowed in in batches. I have no problem with that. No other way to handle the crowds."
"Overall positive, could use maintenance & periodic/seasonal upkeep"
"Parking area is small and minimally structured, however it was adequate for my visit. Can be a bit tedious turning in from/to busy highway."
"Parking area road surface needs pot holes filled in but otherwise we love that the refuge is as natural as it is this close to urban areas. The trails are great!"
"PARKING AREA TOO SMALL, CYCLING IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO WILDLIFE REFUGE"
"PARKING AREAS ARE NOT PLOWED DURING WINTER. SO IMPOSSIBLE TO PARK TO ACCESS REFUGE FOR SNOW SHOEING, ECT. REFUGE IS OPEN TO SOME ACTIVITIES SEPTEMBER TILL FEBRUARY 28,"
"Parking at the boat launch on U.S. Hwy 33 near Tupelo, AR needs to be drastically improved."
"Parking bleeds over into an illegal zone over the weekends because there is no place else. I haven't seen any get ticketed, but if they did I'd consider an injustice."
"Parking can be a serious issue at Sachuest Point because it has a small lot and we saw several people walking up to the lot from the nearby beach to avoid paying for parking there. It was posted that beach parking was prohibited, but it clearly isn't enforced. We went there to enjoy the trails and tranquility of this special spot, but almost had to leave due to lack of parking. Needless to say, we were disappointed to see all the beachgoers returning to their cars when it started raining later."
"Parking can be problematic in the summer. beach goers park for free...although they are not supposed to...and their cars are there all day."
"Parking is always a challenge at some of the wildlife refuges I visit."
"PARKING IS IMPORTANT. THERE ARE FEW VISITORS HERE SO ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT MUCH PARKING IWAS VERY SATISFIED WITH IT"
"Parking is the biggest problem. If you can get funding for one improvement, that would be the biggest satisfier. Also there are regular break-ins of parked vehicles. Another issue is trails shared by bikes and hikers. The trails are not wide enough in some places."
"PARKING LOT ON CASS RIVER IS TOO SMALL"
"PARKING LOTS WERE FULL AT 10:00 AM!"
"Parking spaces are scarce during peak times"
"parking was a little bit of an issue. I arrived in a 24 ft motor home. the only motor home parking was being occupied by the volunteer kiosk. I did find parking but probably more extending parking is warrented"
"PARKING WAS LIMITED, AND IT WAS VERY CROWDED ON THE DAY WE WENT. CARS WERE EVEN PARKED ALONG THE ROAD LEADING TO & FROM THE PARK."
"Part of the refuge is along Broadkill Rd and Prime Hook Rd. Although there are some turnoffs, more turnoffs would be safer for watching birds in the marsh impoundments"
"Particularyly liked the road grates used to prevent wildlife (bison) from leaving refuge"
"Paths were not clearly marked so we turned back to not get lost. Disappointed. Marked when you came upon a pond but expected color coded tree markings to keep on trail to further points of interest."
"Paved road to Ibis pond for wheel chair access would be good."
"People who are new to the area often do not know about the alligators in the refuge lakes and sometimes take pets and children swimming there. Signs around the boat launches warning about the alligators would be helpful."
"Perhaps if they had a sign at the ticket booth indicating they had a tram available for the handicapped. We didn't realize it until we walked all the way up to the lighthouse."
"Physical disabilities can't park south of wolf creek bridges can walk that far."
"PICKNICKING IS INADEQUATE ON BUSY WEEKENDS FORCING CARS INTO SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. REFUGE TRAILS GENERALLY ARE GOO SHAPE THANKS TO VOLUNTEERS."
"pleasd don't open this refuge up to noisy 3/4 wheelers."
"Please do not use gravel on trails, it is noisy and reduces chances to see wildlife tracks, or view birds and wildlife."
"please make the road/trails for both cyclists and joggers wider. It creates a problem for both cyclists and joggers because the road is too narrow for all..."
"Please pave the parking lot. Love Steigerwald!"
"please stock river with more bass n make law NO bass in live well until 2nd weekend of JUNE"
"POOR ACCESS ROAD SIGNAGE. HAD TROUBLE LOCATING MAIN ENTRANCE."
"PORTION OF THE PEBBLE PATH TOWARDS THE ESTUARY BOARDWALK TRAIL NEEDS TO BE PAVED FOR IT TO BE WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE."
"POSTED TRAIL MAPS WERE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TRAILS"
"Potholes. I'm sure with the heavy equipment that is dragged around the oil derricks it messes with the roads and area can flood, thus potholes.  I feel they do a pretty good job filling them but they are there nevertheless."
"Previosly this refuge had a very rough parking and driving surface. Over the past year, improvements have been made so that now the condition is satisfactory."
"Rdwy work redo in past-work subgrade - haul in new flex base (process,run density test and finish to section. did not put fin. Surface, therefore we have chug holes and lime stone dust (unbelievable). wildlike i"
"Really enjoyed being able to drive around. Great experience!"
"Really enjoyed the experience. Will return many more times. Our hiking group which is affiliated with OLLI at UNLV, a program for seniors, found this hike perfect for most of our members."
"RECENT PAY TO PARK THERE - PLACE TO PUT MONEY IN, DOESN'T SAY HOW MUCH AND NO RECEIPT TO LEAVE ON CAR SO I PARK ELSEWHERE"
"Recently fixed the pot holes on the road to the parking area is very appreciated"
"Refuge could use more parking spaces."
"Refuge drive opened later than it should have in the spring because of unsafe road conditions or deteriorated surfaces"
"Refuge is a wonderful area to walk with well maintained trails and bridges."
"refuge is in good condition. it is squaw creek and not loess bluffs. history and tradition have been destroyed making recognition a rebuilding process and disregards local heritage."
"refuge is on an island in the middle of the Ohio River so most of the questions don't apply"
"Refuge was unexpectedly closed on the day we arrived, as there was hunting in the area. This is very disappointing, as it often closes unexpectedly. You must check the website every single visit before you go. Sometimes (as was on this day), I am not near a computer to go on line to check if it's open. It's usually open in the Fall when I've come before."
"Regarding my response about access-I am not sure if there is access for people with disabilities but it would be easily accessible with off-road wheelchairs. Although parking can get tight, parking is sufficient, it is just a popular place during touristseason. Overall, this refuge is well managed."
"Repair/Replace the boat ramp below the mouth of Duck River for access to the Tennessee river."
"Requiring payment for parking seems antithetical to the national park program's mission."
"RIDGEFIELD NWR NEEDS LARGER SIGN FOR TURN OFF FROM MAIN ROAD GOING INTO RIDGEFIELD GOING TO THE 5-UNIT DRIVING LOOP. IF I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE I HAVE MISSED THE TURN."
"Riding on roads is sufficent for people with physical disabilities and/or difficulty walking. You can see everything you need from your vehicle."
"Road access has been recently smoothed out from pot holes and is very appreciated. Trails need to be mowed more often as they tend to grow pretty high and brush and branches hang in the trail walkways."
"Road access is fairly bad. lots of potholes, etc."
"Road condition is not good to drive"
"Road dusty"
"ROAD FLOODS ON HIGH TIDE."
"Road too narrow."
"Roads along dike (flood ways) rough"
"Roads and bridges and walkways have undergone constant improvement over the 40 years I've been hunting there."
"Roads and parking lots are not maintained"
"Roads and parking lots seem well-maintained. Just need more parking (but don't pave the meadows!). Catch 22."
"ROADS ARE ALWAYS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE A THING ABOUT THEM. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE ON MOST STRETCHES, AND WHERE THERE IS NOT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PUUL-OUT AREAS FOR CARS TO STOP AT. THE AUTO TOUR ROAD WAS VERYWELL DISIGNED AND IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED. KIWA TRAIL IS ALWAYS IN GOOD SHAPE, ALSO."
"roads are horrible.trees are being logged and leave the roads in a muddy mess.with our tax money this should not happen.never see any refuge personnel.would visit more often if it wasnt such a hassle.sad.beauitful place."
"Roads are not kept in good conditions. Very poor management of roads."
"Roads are sloppy in rainy weather"
"ROADS COULD BE KEPT UP BETTER - WATER RUNNING ACROSS ROADS GETS DEEP"
"Roads in the refuge are good. Would be nice to have a few more pull over areas so we can park and walk."
"ROADS NEED ATTENTION MANY POT HOLES"
"ROADS NEED IMPROVEMENT"
"Roads need repair, some boat docks need attention, not really handicap accessable"
"Roads need to be graded , log trucks have messed them up purty good!"
"Roads not cleared but 1 time a year. Bird Watch tower parking and ramps only cleared 1 time a year."
"roads should be wider, speed limits enforced"
"ROADS SUCK OPN GEORGE TRACT CACHE ARIVER NWR"
"Roads were rough and very narrow. Difficult to navigate with cars coming from the other direction."
"Roads with potholes wash out roads."
"Roadway needs to be fixed. Too many holes and un even path. Its such a shame for tourists and locals to try and visit a beautiful place, But may feel discouraged to drive forward because of the road condition."
"ROUGH RIDING ON THE TRAIL BUT ENJOYABLE RESPITE FROM BUSY ROADS."
"SACHUEST POINT IS SMALL REFUGE WITH ROAD ONLY IN/OUT. TRAILS SHOULD NOT BE OPEN TO BICYCLES - WOULD NOT WALK ON THESE TRAILS"
"Satisfactory"
"Satisfactory signs and guard rails on wide paths to make it easy to observe and enjoy views."
"Sauchet Point is walking the trails is like going to church"
"Security of parking area very satisfied"
"SEEMED VERY CLEAN AND A STRAIGHT BROAD PATH."
"Several bridges have large pot holes where the road connects to them that really need attention. They do a great job maintaining the roads but never seem to smooth out the road/bridge connection."
"Several queries about trails but at this refuge the signs say to stay in your car."
"Several signs on the kayak/canoe trails were missing. This would have been a real problem if I had not had my GPS. I kayaked the trail #7"
"Shiawassee Refuge is very well maintained from we can see."
"SHOULD CHANGE DIRECTIONS ON THE ONE WAY AUTO ROUTE ONCE IN A WHILE"
"Should have better loarning from highway that the visitor center turn off road is approaching."
"SHOWER FACILITY AT CAMP GROUND IS OLD AND NEED OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. I FOUND IT TO BE DIRTY AND IN DISREPAIR FROM LONG TERM NEGLECT. I STAYED IN LOOP B OF CAMPGROUND. REALLY DISAPPOINTED CONSIDERING HOW WELL THE REST OF THE CAMPGROUND AND AREA IS MAINTAINED."
"SIGN FOR MONSEN ROAD VERY SMALL, EASY TO MISS. NO SIGN IN CONCORD OR BEDFORD CENTER DIRECTING ONE TO REFUGE."
"Signage from state routes directing people into the refuge could be a little better. Some trails were overgrown (high grass) and flooded from recent heavy rain. More opportunities to view and access the river on Middle Island would be nice, especially ontrails for wildlife photography. Most trails were just walking through the forest with not many river views."
"signage in park is kind of poor"
"Signage in town specifying which way to dock and which way to fish cleaning station. Also, a bigger sign on the road instructing people to turn in to town. Current sign is quite small."
"SIGNAGE IS GREAT, ROADS/PARKING EXCELLENT"
"Signage is needed on Pioneer St. in Ridgefield for directions to the River S Unit."
"Signage is visible at extremely close proximity to turn off on a busy state highway."
"Signage on dike trails to show you where you were was very good."
"Signage on main street is difficult to see"
"Signage on the highway was visible but not obvious, and the directions given (""next left"") were not clear. I did not see a sign at the next left, or any subsequent left. I had to pull over and ask where the refuge was at a local nursery.  I had a map for the refuge trails, but some on-trail signage would have been helpful to confirm location."
"Signage on trails could be better marked, otherwise this is a beautiful place to go hiking with my children and see wildlife."
"Signing to places from the main roads was poor. We had to search and ask several times."
"SIGNS ARE VITAL TO OUT OF THE AREA VISITORS. PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN & KEEP THEM UP. TRAILS MARKING ARE VITAL, WOULD BE GREAT IF ON-LINE RESOURCES ABOUT ALL REFUGES WERE EASIER/MORE USER FRIENDLY."
"Signs describing 'no dogs / no jogging / no bicycles' etc etc are understated. Some people jog on these trails and refuse to stop. Also, some trails have seasonal closures yet some people ignore them or choose to since the signs are few and again pretty understated."
"Signs from main visitor center to homestead not visable when leaving main visitor center"
"Signs marking level of inclines on hiking trails for those that are able to walk; but have significant issues with inclines"
"Signs were old looking and small"
"Since I traveled through this refuge on a paddle-wheel boat, I could not really rate the quality of the amenities inside the land-based part of the refuge."
"Since roads @ pinckney are not open to vehicles they are great. Also toured Savannah, very happy there"
"Since they are non-existent, there is nothing to say. It would be nice to have driving access on Recovery 1 Road but I understand this does not belong to the refuge but to the City of New Orleans. It would be an asset to have a driving tour there."
"Small carpark opposite trailhead. Trail was well signposted and parking was close."
"Smoother Trails for the Handicaped."
"SNWR is a great resource in our area."
"SO FAR, THE PARKING SPACE & BOAT LAUNCH HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED PROPERLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WHAT TRULY NEEDS MODERNIZING EVEN REPLACED IS THE BATHROOM/TOILET FACILITY!!! AT THE BOAT LAUNCH"
"so popular that more parking space is needed."
"some area flooded"
"Some areas need spots to pull over to hunt off the roads they build. So people can get by or with out you taking chance of getting stuck. Roads were mowed this year so that helps a lot. But they do a great job An I'm overall satisfied"
"Some gravel roads I would like to see paved"
"Some more pullovers would be nice. Basically, however, this refuge and volunteer group is top drawer."
"Some of the boat ramps needs work. The most recent improvements at the West End Boat Ramp have been very useful, were desperately needed, and are much appreciated. Crab Orchard Marina needs its own boat ramp. If a boat becomes disabled in the marina, it must be towed into another cove, quite a distance, to reach West End Boa Ramp. Why have so many roads been closed to public access? I'd like to see many of these reopened."
"SOME OF THE HIKING TRAILS COULD BE BETTER MAINTAINED. SOME BECOME IMPASSABLE FOR MONTHS AT A TIME"
"Some of the trail signs are in such bad condition that the only legible word is ""trail."""
"Some of the trails are a little overgrown and hard to pass through."
"Some of the trails were closed for maintenance and we were unaware of that when we left the visitor's center. We had to double back to get back to our car and there wasn't much signage to show us we were going in the right direction. The map from the visitor's center was also a bit outdated because some of the trails that is showed were no longer there. It was not a problem for us but it might be for other hikers not planning to walk such a long distance."
"SOME OF THE WALKING/HIKING TRAILS EVEN THOUGH NOT FOR BIKE USE BUT PEOPLE, I FEEL COULD BE TRIMMED BACK A BIT WIDER IT WON'T KEEP TICKS OFF. YOU I UNDERSTAND THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS IN FOR BEFORE ENTERING BUT I FEEL IT COULD HELP A BIT, MY LAST VISIT THEREWERE SEVERAL TREES DOWN ON THE WALKING TRAILS ONLY A FEW TRAVERSE."
"some people use the roads for a race track. put I don't know how you can stop that."
"SOME PLACES ROAD REPAIR. SOME PLACES ROAD CLOSED."
"Some pot holes need filled and rough patches smoothed."
"Some roads were in poor shape"
"Some trails need gravel surface repair so that they are not so muddy."
"Some trails were slightly difficult for strollers"
"Some walking trails and stopping places for cars must be continuously repaired and their signage updated because of the cliff erosion of the park's border on the Straits of Juan de Fuca. Some of these often have to be closed. Too bad but necessary."
"SOME WILDLIFE REFUGES HAVE A TRAIN OR BUS FOR FOLKS UNABLE TO DRIVE/WALK TRAILS - ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH BY RESERVATION WOULD BE AMAZING WITH/NATURAL INTERPRETATION"
"Something needs to be done in order to facilitate the departure from the boat ramp onto 278. To say it is dangerous pulling out with a boat in tow is an understatement."
"SOMETIME THE TRAILS ARE FLOODED"
"SOMETIME THERE ARE RARE OR UNUSUAL BIRDS. IF ENOUGH VOLUNTEERS ARE AVAILABLE, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE RARITY WERE TALKED OUT AND POINTED OUT"
"SOMETIMES UNABLE TO GET A PARKING SPACE ESPECIALLY ON A SUMMER WEEKEND"
"SPEED BUMPS ARE ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP TRAFFIC SLOWED DOWN."
"Speed limit posted at access to island, people do not obey and there are not signs on the road to remind them. People drive too fast for walkers and bicyclists."
"STAFF HELPFUL"
"STEIGERWALD REFUGE IS A NO DOG, BIKE OR JOGGING REFUGE. I HAVE SEEN ALL 3 AT IT. YOU MUST BETTER SIGN WITH BIGGER SIGNS & LETTERING RIGHT AT THE HIGHWAY PULLOFF & AT THE START OF THE MAIN TRAIL. SINCE IT IS VERY CLOSE TO A MAJOR POPULATION AREA. MOST OFLKS THINK IT IS A PARK & COME TO USE IT THAT WAY. SIGNAGE THAT EXPLAINS ITS PRUPOSE WOULD BE HELPFUL. SOME ENFORCEMENT WOULD HELP"
"STEPS TO ""OVERLOOK"" NEED REPAIRS. MORE GRAVEL FILLED IN."
"Surface is okay for ""off road wheelchair"""
"thank you"
"Thank you for your active participation in studying this area."
"Thank You! I love our parks. When your in the park taking the photo of the one thing you have been looking for. It makes your day."
"Thank you. I enjoyed my visit."
"The 'forest trail' boardwalk was slippery (wood surface, damp). Adding some type of tread material for better traction would help."
"The access road is a bit hidden, but that's not such a bad thing - one of the treats of this place is that it's a hidden gem."
"The addition of the paved access road has made visiting the refuge safer. The old dirt road would occasionally wash out in thunderstorms and make getting to the ranger station more difficult."
"The auto-tour should be open EVERY DAY."
"The back roadways are rough, but the recent paving of the road to corncreek is amazing. Love the new visitor center. It is a desert and we cannot expect all roads to be smooth."
"The Balcones Canyon Songbird Festival was very well organized and provided safe van transportation to the areas of the refuge that were visited. The wildlife refuge staff and volunteers made sure that everyone"
"THE BISCOE AREA OF THE CACHE RIVER NWR HAS BEEN LOGGED FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS W/ABSOLUTELY NO MAINTENANCE ON THE MAIN ROPAD IE GRAVEL, ROAD GRATING. THE AREA HAS NOT BEEN BUSH-HIGGED IN OVER A YEAR"
"The boardwalk at one of our stops was very short. both trails we went on were fairly overgrown & there were loose boards. Woud have loved to been able to go into the Fort."
"The boardwalk at the larger trail site was in disrepair, broken boards at several places and the entire thing looked like it needed to be treated against rain/moisture."
"The boardwalks are terribly slippery in the wet season!"
"The boat dock at Williams tour nees new cleats to tie boat to docl. There is only half a cleat remaining on the dock right now"
"The boat docks need to be updated and they need to be put out into the water before April. Now sometimes its not till the middle of May until they are installed. Ruining my boat having to beach it to load and unload."
"The boat launch at Big Branch Marsh is not well-maintained, and the trail and Boyscout Road desperately needs a garbage can at the trailhead."
"The boat launch doesn't have any signs labeling it as the boat ramp location from the road, I accidentally went past it before I realized and turned around."
"The boat ramps are very poorly designed and maintained. And whos Idea was it to heap massive rocks next to the ramps. There is almost no place for a handicapped person to access the waters edge if they want to fish. Well designed, patron friendly refuge amenities are not hard to find and study. As far as we can tell the only people who earn their wages out there (Kirwin Res.) are the wardens."
"The bridge at Wolf Creek Causeway is in need of repair, built in 1939."
"The bridge into the NWR is only one lane and looks very old. Please replace to make it a two lane bridge. Thank you for your consideration."
"The bridge leading you to the island seems to be needing repair in the near future."
"The bridge needs repaired and spruced up."
"THE BRIDGE TO GET TO THE ISLAND COULD USE A LOT OF WORK TRAILS NEED WORK WHERE IT FLOODED"
"THE BRIDGE TO MIDDLE ISLAND LOOKS TERRIBLE! NEEDS MAINTENANCE"
"The bridge to the Island is scheduled to be replaced. During its replacement time, will there be alternate access to at least part of the Island?"
"the brush along the road is getting to tall to see passed it. with the addition of all the wet lands you can not see the animals as well as before"
"THE BUSHES NEED TO BE TRIMMED AROUND THE REFUGE SIGN."
"The cane bayou boat launch could stand to be re-graded."
"The cobble stones need replacing"
"The condition of the roads etc was excellent, but there could be more signage and more pull-overs for observation on the driving route."
"The condition of the top layer of material (either decomposed granite or native soil/sand) is critical for the usability of each trail path. Bridges and signage are in excellent condition. The trails tend to get narrow, washed out, and overgrown as you gofurther down each path."
"The downhill dirt road leading to the refuge might benefit from a little maintenance if I recall correctly. Some regrading might be in order to deal with washboarding."
"THE DRIVE FOR CARS NEEDS TO BE OPEN MORE THAN JUST JUNE-SEPTEMBER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO USE THE TRAILS TO ENJOY THE REFUGE. OLDER VISITORS ARE THE ONES MORE LIKELY MAKING DONATIONS AND THEY ARE VERY LIMITED IN THE TIME THEY CAN ENJOY THE REFUGE THROUGHTOUT THE YEAR."
"The drive itself is great with all the scenery."
"The end of the bridge on the refuge is very rough and hard on my vehicle. I would like to see that improved."
"The entrance road to the Hanalei NWR currently says ""local traffic only"" even though there is no road work being done or road damage on the way to the NWR entrance. This was put in after the Kauai flooding."
"The entrance to the S - unit of Ridgfield NWR has an old, one lane bridge and a railroad crossing. When we arrived a train had stopped on the tracks. So we started our visit that day at the Carty unit."
"THE ENTRY ROAD & BRIDGE LEADING TO THE REFUGE ARE IN POOR CONDITION AND ARE NOT SAFE."
"The facilities have been upgraded very well in the last few years at DNWR and it works well, particularly like the crossing signs warning of desert tortoises.."
"The fact that the refuge road is one way traffic is perfect and much safer for visitors."
"The fact that you have to shuttle into the area helps in the safety and overall experience of being there."
"THE GRAVEL ROAD CONSTANTLY NEEDS MAINTENANCE - HUGE POTHOLES NEVER GOT COMPLETELY FILLED."
"the gravel road that leads to the Ritidian Wildlife Refuge is in very poor condition, with very large potholes that are almost unavoidable."
"THE GRAVEL ROADS THAT MAKE UP MAJORITY OF WALKING TRAILS, NO VEHICLES EXCEPT NOW & THEN WILDLIFE RANGER TRUCK ARE QUITE ROCKY MAKING IT HARD TO WALK FOR OLDER PEOPLE OR UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE REST OF US. REALLY ONLY COMPLAINT IN ENTIRE WONDERFUL REFUGE :)"
"The guided boat tour was very informative and well done. It gave visitors close up encounters with the magical beauty of the wildlife, plants and natural features of the refuge."
"THE HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE VIEWING STATION WAS BUILT TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE ON WHEELCHAIR TO IT"
"The harder to find the better. It is a refuge for animals so the least humans who can find it the better :)"
"THE INTERNET MAPS DID NOT CORRESPOND TO THE ENTRANCES OF THE REFUGE. VERY CONFUSING SIGNAGE. WE DROVE FOR 45 MINS AROUND UNTIL WE FOUND WAY IN THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR."
"THE LANE TO TURN INTO THE REFUGE IS FAIRLY WHORT - BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE, BUT COULD BE LONGER FOR ADDITONAL CARS OF ACCESS."
"The laws for disabled folks is nearly non existent its wrong and needs to be more accommodations made I can't walk have to use atv only gun deer season I'm allowed to do this and then I can only go 300' oof of road that's recrimination"
"The main access roads to the Refuge areas are severely dilapidated, can cause motorize vehicles damages and in recent visit (caught on my video dashcam) near collision with a visitor and reckless Tour van driver. Reckless speeding through these dilapidated roads with vehicles to its advantage is a problem and safety issue for people visiting the refuge."
"The map for the trails is extremely hard to understand."
"The map provided had incorrect information regarding the trails and resulted in a lengthy detour, which was rather frustrating. Otherwise, it was good."
"The new boardwalk through the wetland is a FANTASTIC benefit for wheelchair users, one of whom is my wife. She cannot see such areas without such accommodations, as she uses a powered wheelchair that requires very smooth surfaces and transitions."
"The Nisqually Wildlife Refuge is a wonderful place. However, I am in a wheelchair and must comment on the poor condition of the wooden, warped walk ways.These make  for a very bumpy ride, indeed. Disabled parking is greatly appreciated, though."
"The northeast side of the 10 mile loop could use more gravel if possible. It gets pretty muddy with moisture"
"The number of boat ramps on Crab are dwindling"
"The number of spaces at the parking lot at Great Meadows, Concord is very adequate during the week but can be quite over crowded at times on the weekends. It seems to be an increasingly popular destination for many."
"The NWR paved the road into refuge HQ a few years ago. I always wondered where the money came from!"
"The one way wooden bridge at the entrance is difficult to negotiate. It is hard to see oncoming cars and there is not sign warning people of the conditions."
"The only issue I encounter while at the refuge is boaters not following the posted speed limit. People boating at high speeds tubing back and fourth on the river greatly takes away from the fishing experience. The wake created by these activities can behazardous to kayaks/canoes/small boats."
"THE ONLY THING I WISH IS THERE WER MORE PLACES TO PULL OVER FOR FASTER CARS BEHIND US."
"The only thing I would point out is the gravel on the road the bikes use is hard to ride on and makes for bumpy traveling. I wish it was smoother."
"The park trail system is well maintained and the map at the park was very clear."
"The parking at the boat ramp needs better lighting. The light did not work this year"
"THE PARKING LOT ALWAYS IS MAINTAINED VERY WELL WITH PLENTY OF PARKING AVAILABLE. THE RESTROOM IS VERY NICE & CLEAN"
"The parking lot is tiny but I think there's already plan's under way to fix that."
"The parking lot was not very big, and it was pretty muddy."
"The parking lots had guides with walkie talkies. We rented an SUV and the guides expected us to squeeze it into a very small space. We did, but after switching drivers and doing about a 9 point turn. Everyone had to get out of the car before we parked because the doors couldn't open once we were in the spot."
"the parking was acceptable, even though the area was not quite fixed up but seems safe."
"THE PART OF THE REFGUGE I USE OFF OF US HWY 11. THERE ARE 2 BIG PONDS CALLED BARROW PITS, THESE WER DUG IN THE 60'S TO GET FILL FOR INTERSTATE 10. THIS IS A GREAT URBAN FISHERY BUT IN THE PAST YEAR THE CANAL GOING TO PONDS ARE BLOCK AND UNPASSABLE. LILY PADS & DEBRI HAS BLOCKED CANAL. NO ONE SEEMS TO BE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE A NICE LAUNCH AND PARKING LOT AND NOWHERE TO GO ONCE YOU LAUNCH. THANKS, DON"
"The pathways in front of the lawn area used to be comfortable to walk on. Now the gravel on it is too deep and is harder to walk on. I think it would be impossible for a wheelchair."
"The public access road to the refuge is terrible. But it is not the responsibility of the refuge. I believe it is the responsibility of the U.S. government."
"The question regarding how far (timewise) I traveled from home is misleading. I traveled several hours from where I live to get to the refuge, but only traveled an hour from where I was staying to get there. So the answer could be 5 hours or 1 hour depending on my starting point."
"The refuge could use more finely ground gravel treatment on trial path that is on the same side as the observation deck. The rocks used to cover certain parts of the trail on that side are too large."
"The refuge is beautiful, and we appreciated the kindness and professionalism of volunteers and staff. Thank you for seeking our feedback."
"The refuge is great! I do wish that there were more paved trails so my chronically ill son could do more there. We couldn't push his wheelchair on the gravel paths. We did enjoy one ploed path which is appreciate"
"THE REFUGE IS LOCATED ON A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY #99. SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY FROM A STOPPED POSITION AND PICK UP ENOUGH SPEED TO ENTER THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. MAYBE A MERGE LANE WOULD HELP? WHERE YOU COULD ACCELERATE"
"The refuge is right off of a highway and only a short distance. Many questions assumed you drove quit a ways to get to the refuge."
"The refuge law enforcement budget does not support adequate coverage for monitoring speeding on the refuge. Speeders create a dangerous situation, since most people are going very slowly or stopping to watch wildlife."
"The refuge maintains the roads very well. We have never had a problem with potholes, or any parking problems. It's very easy to navigate."
"The refuge needs more benches. One of the people with me has difficulty walking and ended up not being able to continue on the trails with us because there were not enough benches for her to continue."
"The refuge seems to promote thub its rds are primative & they lived up to that! If not intent to be primative then they are not doing a very good job. I came prepared for very primative & that what was there."
"THE REFUGE WAS WELL MARKED, IT WAS EASY TO PARK AND THE SIGNAGE/INFORMATION PROVIDED WAS EXCELLENT."
"the road condition was extremely good, good paved road. There was plenty of parking spots and enough road side pulling space. The curves were broad and over all good road condition."
"The road consition to the refugre was really bad, it would ruin certain small cars"
"THE ROAD DOWN THE HILL FROM THE PAVED CITY ROAD TO THE SLOUGH NEEDS TO BE WIDENED AND GRADED."
"The road entering the refuge is only wide enough for one car. That is a problem when two cars are entering and leaving the refuge at the same time. The Reformatory Branch walking and biking trail intersects the road entering the refuge. This intersection of cars and bikes is not well labeled and is dangerous, especially for cyclists."
"The road going around the duck and goose area was one way!!!"
"THE ROAD INTO GREAT MEADOWS IS NARROW. SIGNS DIRECTING ONE TO IT DIFFICULT TO SEE."
"THE ROAD INTO THE WILD LIFE LOOP IS ROUGH."
"The road leading into the refuge, although not part of the refuge, are horrible!!! Need to at just be have pot holes filled. Can only drive >5mph down the road."
"The road leading to the refuge is absolutely horrible. The deep potholes are dangerous and no one follows the rules when driving out of the refuge in order to avoid said potholes. I felt very uneasy driving into the refuge worrying if my van would make it. It's a shame the roads are so unsafe, I'd be inclined to visit more often if it wasn't so bad."
"The road leading to the refuge is in need of repair. The potholes have gotten worst in the last 6 months. Also a sign at the beginning of the pothole road letting visitors know refuge hours (in English and Japanese) would be super helpful for tourists. I've seen many Japanese tourists heading to the refuge when it is already closed."
"The road leading to the refuge is in terrible condition, somebody needs to adopt/maintain it, I almost turned back to avoid damaging my car"
"THE ROAD SIGNS DIRECTING YOU TO THE REFUGE ARE EXCELLENT"
"The road to Deadman's Canyon trailhead is pretty rough. Saw two cars broke down that needed towing. However, it is pretty well mentioned on the website that a high-clearance vehicle is VERY recommended/encouraged."
"The road to Rititian Beach is horrific. Potholes like I have never seen anywhere. Quite dangerous and ridiculous if you ask me. The military should provide a safer road."
"The road to the refuge was horrible, not the roads on the refuge just the roads to the refuge, terribly potholes, and Guam has lots of potholes but I was actually worried about our vehicle on this road since it was our first time out there, we didn't knowwhat to expect. There needs to be an effort to improve the road out to the refuge, off the main road, 1 I think is the main road"
"The road was in really good condition on this visit."
"THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW. PASSING LOG TRUCKS WAS SCARY GRASS WAS NOT MOWED"
"The road way getting to the Guam National Wildlife is a safety concern and also discourages the public from utilizing the refuge. The plan for the LFTRC runs counter to the mission of the refuge and park systems. Shame on DOD and the park service for allowing this destruction to take place."
"The road we use is quite nice. It winds through the forest and we have a good opportunity to see many birds. I feel safe stopping along the road to rest or watch wildlife. We go the forest on an average of six time a week."
"The roads are gravel, narrow and 1-way, which helps maintain desired slow speed of motorists through the refuge. It thus promotes safety for people and wildlife, quietness/calming for relaxation and not startling wildlife., and overall cooperation for shared experiences."
"The roads are in very poor condition at all times. The wash boards are terrible. They will tear the front end out of your truck. Also when the maintenance worker goes to fix the roads he just dumps a big load of rock in the middle of the road and doesn't spread it out at all. Some of the rocks are bigger than a grapefruit. It has been this way for years. The refuge I am referring to is Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge."
"The roads are never kept up in decent condition. The sides of the roads are the biggest problem. They should be mowed in the summer, by the time hunting season rolls around, you cant pull off the road."
"The roads are terrible and need worked on"
"THE ROADS COULD USE SOME GRADING"
"The roads didn't seem to be maintained at all"
"The roads have good rock coverage, just need to blade roads to get rid of washboards and pot holes."
"The roads inside the refuge are great. But the 4 Mile access road into the refuge once you turn off of the main road is terrible. The cycling club from St Mary's that I belong to ride up here where I live in Folkston to ride. The Okefenokee swamp used tobe a regular part of our ride. But because the access road into the swamp is so rough and has pot holes. The swamp has been removed from our route. The road is made of some type of rough small stone chip seal, it is not bicycle friendly. Road bikes have no shocks and 1/2 inch wide wheels.We have experienced a few flats just riding into the swamp on the access road. And it vibrates and shakes our bikes so bad. That we have removed the Okefenokee from our ride. We ride from the court house in Folkston andhave usually rode on average 15 to 20 miles before riding the 10 miles to the wildlife entrance. So the last thing we want at that stage is to have us and our bikes shook so badly. Once into the swamp parking area from there on out, the roads are well maintained and smooth. If they can provide that type of road within the swamp, then why not on the access road that starts at the National Wildlife sign. I've talked to other cyclist in the area and they have also scratched the refuge off of their rides inthe area. I ride a recumbent trike, low to the ground with two wheels in the front and one in the back with wide soft riding tires so it's not as bad for me. But that road has caused many cyclist to avoid the refuge and all that it offers."
"The roads leading to this refuge are too rough to drive and feel worry to may get damage of cars and reluctant to go there again!!!"
"The roadways could be slightly better than they are now just for the fact that there are some potholes that if hit could really damage a low riding vehicle such as my own."
"The shell rock road and the 2 boat ramps inside the southern Lox Road entrance are adequate."
"The short entrance road is very narrow. It is sometimes difficult to pull over when a come is coming in the opposite direction."
"The sign at the T from the visitor center to the ocean loop trail (to the right) and the Flint Pt trail (to the left) is gone. It's fine for me, but new visitors may be confused."
"The sign leading to the pond in which the osprey & other wildlife gathered was not visible from the main road. We discovered it because we noticed many visitors on this trail. this area is the highlight of our"
"The signage on Kauai is dismal, but I think I like it like that. It goes along with the Island life there. It also keeps the foot traffic down on some of the harder to find trails and beaches. It's kind of an adventure!"
"The signs on the far side of the main loop where the trail branches off are fairly confusing"
"The signs showing where the trails are and where they go are extremely helpful! I'm hoping to walk all of them one day!"
"THE SIGNS TO LOCATE THE DESERT NATURAL WILDLIFE REFUGE ARE TOO SMALL AND CLOSE TO THE ACCESS ROAD. ALSO, THERE IS NO EXIT LANE OFF US 95 NORTH, SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE SHOULDER LANE."
"The staff at Sullys Hill do a fantastic job. We love them being in our community."
"The State of WV needs to complete the bridge restoration project that was approved a couple years ago. The old bridge is very rough and in disrepair."
"THE SURFACE OF THE CORN CREEK FIELD STATION TRAILS HAS BEEN POORLY MANAGED. GRAVEL BINDER DOES NOT WORK AND THE GRAVEL BECOMES LOOSE & VERY LOUD!"
"The Sweetwater Marsh Unit does not allow cars to enter. A shuttle bus carries visitors to the Discovery Center, and my visits there are to see the exhibits. However, I frequently use the South San Diego Bay Unit as a cycling corridor."
"The trail surfaces were recently made unusable by wheelchairs and difficult and noisy to walk on. This was done by staff, who installed deep gravel, too deep to solidify with a fixative. The damage is being repaired, and it seems the paths will fairly soon be 75% as usable as they were before work began."
"The trail was in extremely bad shape and not safe. There were no signs as to progress on this steep trail and I thought I might pass out it was so hot, humid and lack of air flow."
"The trailhead was not well marked. It seemed like traffic was not supposed to go down the road that the trail head was on."
"The trailheads where well-marked, but we came across areas with apparent multiple trails and no markings (even simple small ones) at all. Some of the signs to the lakes could be better too - you'd see on sign and follow it with no updating sign with whereto turn or how many miles to the destination."
"The trails by the Sweetwater River Bridge have scarce parking, and there's nowhere to pull off alongside the road due to landscape features. We were lucky someone was leaving when we arrived so we got a spot but otherwise it was a create-your-own-spot kind of free-for-all situation for parking."
"The trails could be maintained a bit better - there are many areas with holes or large rocks that can be dangerous. Additionally, the vegetation becomes overgrown on several of the trails, making them unusable"
"THE TRAILS SHOULD BE WIDER FOR PASSING. I HATE WHEN RUNNERS APPROACH ME FROM BEHIND."
"The trails were recently ruined by the addition of deep gravel that is extremely noisy and difficult to walk on. The trails were excellent before the gravel was added. I know staff is aware of the problem and is working on it, but they keep trying to makethe gravel work when what they should be doing is removing it."
"The transportation-related features at this refuge are inadequate; narrow, poorly maintained roadways, inadequate road shoulders, non-existent or distant observation points."
"The transportation features at John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge are great. Even though the refuge is so close to the Philadelphia International Airport, signage to get to the refuge is clear and helpful. The parking lot is smooth. The trails are clean.The maps along the trail that appear to be brand new -- at least their pristine condition made it seem that way. The visitor's center, while I only popped in briefly to use the restroom, was very impressive just from a quick stroll through. Accessible, safe, welcoming, clean would be words I would use to describe these features."
"The turn-in lane to BCNWR has recently being worked on. There was dust and traffic galore. This will be a one-off problem though."
"The vast majority of refuge roads could only be accessed by off-road type vehicles."
"The volunteer that helped us out and signed us up for the survey was resourceful"
"The walkways to the docks are very steep at low tide so extra grips on the walkway or signs might be helpful to warn tourist"
"THE WEEDS WERE OVERGTROWING ON THE TRAIL LAST TIME, LIKE IT HADN'T BEEN CLEARED AND IT MADE IT HARD TO WALK THROUGH."
"The welcome center of Noxubee could update their wildlife museum and the video displayed in the small theatre more often."
"The youth hunt was a great experience for my son. He enjoyed every minute of the classes, and the hunt itself. The volunteers are to be commended. The Sponsors also did a wonderful job, especially ZINK Calls! I enjoyed it too! Thank you to all who made this happen!"
"There's a foot-sized hole in the boardwalk just past the visitors' center that needs to be fixed. The alligators like to sun in that area."
"There's mainly one road to have access to this refuge and to move inside of the park. So several questions are out of our experience."
"There are a fair amount of benches/places to sit but more would be helpful for people who need to sit and rest a lot"
"There are always parking spaces so I appreciate that."
"there are huge pot holes in the entrance road to the refuge. The boardwalk is completely overgrown with vegetation. there are no pull offs along hwy 11."
"There are no boat ramps at the Desert National Wildlife Refuge. I couldn't un-click the choices to rate boat ramps. Many of the trails there are accessible, some are more difficult than others due to location and natural terrain issues. Overall I think they do an excellent job with accessibility. The visitor center has many wonderful educational exhibits that cover the animals, flora and original peoples who have lived in the area. It's a little jewel in the Las Vegas area."
"THERE ARE NO ROADS INSIDE THE REFUGE, ONLY TRAILS."
"There are no roads on this refuge except for the parking areas. The hiking trails are in excellent shape. I appreciate that they are not open for bike riding and jogging."
"There are not any Any parking areas available around trail entrances. More times than not the dirt road or in poor condition. Since the logging of the refuge there has been no updates to the conditions of the roads or parking areas. Where is all this money going to?"
"There are not too many parking spots at the refuge parking area. However, there are many parking spots at the city owned park (Captain William Clark Park) nearby with a trail between the two, so signs indicating people are able to park there would be useful. Traffic on highway 14 is extremely heavy and fast at times, without a really good solution to make it safer, and thus I park at Captain William Clark Park."
"THERE ARE SEVERAL LARGE LONG HIDN'T CRACKS FORMING ON THE MAJOR ROAD THAT CREATES A REAL HAZARD FOR ROAD CYCLST."
"There are very few places to pull over on the auto tour road to observe wildlife. The sign on the highway indicating the refuge turn is coming up small."
"There are wells on the island that may be used in the future. We used to wash or spray off our truck years ago."
"There could be better signage from the highway to the refuge. It is getting a bit overgrown, the turn is a little hard to see."
"There does need more access for people with disabilities"
"There is a lot of pass through and oil and gas traffic through the Refuge. They speed and sometimes run over wildlife."
"There is a road bridge that is condemned that seems to be politically motivated as it is still in use by private individuals. It is disappointing to let public land become more difficult due to local politics. Someone should address this issue and moneycould be raised by access fees, NWTF grants, Etc. to take on this access issue."
"THERE IS A SINGLE LANE BRIDGE TO ENTER RIDGEFIELD NWR WHICH WOULD BENEFIT FROM A TRAFFIC SIGNAL TO REGULATE IT"
"there is enough parking right now, but austin is growing and the small parking lot will not be enough in the near future (I think 5-10yrs)"
"THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PARKING ON WEEK-ENDS AND HOLIDAYS."
"There is only one sign on the highway, exactly at the entrance. There should be at least one more going north. I'm sure that would help with more visitors."
"There is unclear information posted by the refuge when spraying glycosphate or other herbicides.  The signs should state specifically which area or trail is being sprayed, and when. The spray should be color tinted so we can see clearly what areas to avoid."
"There need to be more pull-offs on the main road heading to HQ around the fields."
"There needs to be 2-3 more checkout stations to cut down on travel time"
"There needs to be a better sign off of the highway. You go over the canal and boom you have to immediately come to a halt because you're going 55 and it's not super visable."
"There needs to be better accomodation for walkers where only trail is the bike path."
"There only one small sign directly in front of refuge. It is easy to miss it."
"There should be a left turn lane on I-95 south to turn onto to the road leading to the refuge. Cars are travelling very fast on I-95 and having to slow down and make a turn from the left lane (i.e. fast lane) of this highway is dangerous."
"There should be at least one Port-a-John to use. Many elderly people do not use the refuge at all because the gravel is so difficult to walk on. Very hard place to get around. Unlike, Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, where you can easily drive your car to explore the area."
"There should not be bikes here, they are prohibited, but people still ride their bikes on the trails. I tell them they are not allowed but they generally ignore me LOL. I know park funds have been cut which is a crime in my opinion, but more rangers wouldhelp. I think bigger signs would help too, bigger signs that say NO BIKES ON REFUGE, because the signs, along with the no dogs signs, are easy to miss."
"There was a super cheerful parking lot employee/volunteer who was very helpful and welcoming. It was nice to be greeted and directed to efficient parking."
"there was no on-road signage directing me to other POIs in the refuge. for example, no signage from ""main"" lot to handicapped-accessible alligator viewing"
"There was not a clear indication of where the staging area for the trail was. We parked in a City of Chula Vista Park parking lot and then wandered around until we found the trailhead. The trails in the refuge were all unmarked and it was difficult to navigate."
"THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROAD & ONE WAY TO GO. ROAD WAS GOOD BUT NARROW WITH JUST A FEW PLACES TO PULL OVER."
"There were no signs directing me. Someone gave me a physical address and that is how we found it."
"There were no signs directing traffic to the refuge. We discovered a road during our visit to Hanalei on Maui, HI and started driving down it. In a short while we saw a small roadside sign designating the area as a wildlife sanctuary. It did not have adesignated gate as the road also had residences along it as well as fields growing taro. The road was a mixture of gravel/dirt and no wider than two lanes."
"THERE WERE VERY FEW PARKING SPOTS"
"THEY DO A GOOD JOB WITH MAINTAINING THE TRAILS AND ADDING NEW STONES TO KEEP THE TRAILS FROM GETTING TO MUDDY"
"THEY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF KEEPING THE WALKWAYS"
"THEY NEED TO HAVE SIGNS FOR BOATS TO FOLLOW WATERWAYS RULES. HAVE NO WAKE ZONE SIGNS PUT BACK UP BAYOU AREAS."
"They need to improve the boat ramp at Foord's Landing. It is in need of repair to launch boat safely."
"They removed speedbumps which is good at 20mph."
"They spent millions of dollars on a road that gets very little traffic. Total waste of money."
"They were in the process of logging out sections of the refuge we've been hunting for 20 years. The main gravel road that goes thru refuge was in bad shape due to all the machinery and 18 wheeler hauling out the logs. This was being done during a wet summer and fall and continued while it was still wet conditions. The gravel road thru the refuge that took so long to complete and make it accessible has been converted back to a mud road. It's a shame they log out a Federal Wildlife Refuge and let them leaveit in suck poor conditions,woods and roads when they leave!!"
"This area had just gotten under way when I left in 2000. So many species! So beautiful! My godmother loves it so much. Keep it up!"
"This is a great refuge"
"This is a lovely refuge and well maintained by thoughtful caring volunteers."
"This is a wonderful location that rates excellent in all areas in my opinion."
"This is a wonderful refuge keep up the good work. Money well spent !"
"This is an urban refuge, so I love the care that went into separating rails for bikes & pedestrians. Also signage is excellent, especially signs painted by kids, which don't seem to get vandalized as much and c"
"This is is nice place and when ever i have some spare time I am visiting all those wildlife refuges in the New Orleans area."
"This is our favorite refuge. And although we love hiking and walking to see birds, we love that you can cover so much ground at Ridgefield and it makes it easy for everyone to see the birds."
"This is the first refuge I've been to where a Discover Pass was not required in Washington State (Thank goodness for that) and that also had nice walking trails. There's a wildlife refuge near my parents house south of Salem Oregon that does not have anywalking trails. I like that this has walking trails and informative signs."
"This location is easy to reach, easy drive and parking, restrooms and is never overcrowded."
"This NWR has done a great job accommodating various means of transportation."
"This particular area has no signage posted. There are no marked trails. I do not particularly care if the trails are maintained or marked. I like the area just the way it is."
"This particular refuge has primative roads"
"This particular refuge is very underdeveloped"
"This place is my little piece of heaven.it's perfect."
"This refuge also has a very nicely constructed bike trail. It would be more highly used and enjoyed if there is some type of barrier to break the wind, preferrably trees or some type of greenery."
"this refuge consists of a parking area, hiking trails and a wonderful,paved bicycle road. motored vehicles are not allowed on these trails roads. refuge located on 13th st at the southern most area of san diego"
"This refuge could use a few more parking places"
"This refuge has added a few more pull over places this year which is nice and makes travel much after if you spot wildlife or want to walk to a gated road that you have somewhere to park"
"THIS REFUGE HAS NO ROADS OTHER THAN THE ENTRANCE"
"This refuge has two locations- the main facility and the Bailey Tract. The parking area at the Bailey Tract is horrible. It is a dirt parking lot that is mostly deep holes. Given that the Tract was closed for a construction project for four months this summer, it would have made sense for them to fix the parking lot by grading it with the equipment they used for the project."
"This refuge is fairly small but has a lot of visitors. On busy weekends, there are not enough parking spaces. Everyone seems pretty safe when they are driving on the short road even when it is crowded though."
"This refuge is for hiking and biking mostly. I like taking my dog there"
"This refuge is great. Our main complaint in the area is that hunters are not respectful of other people's area usage and present a risk to hikers, bikers, and other area users."
"This refuge is so special, and I love that driving the loop is low key, with minimal impact on nature. I can see room for improvement in creating more safe areas to pull over and park, but hope that impact on the nature is extremely minimal."
"This refuge needs better, and more launch areas for hand launching canoe kayaks. A gradual dirt grade into the water to slide the boats in. In some areas the banks is too steep. Big Mineral day use area."
"This refuge needs more walking trails and: This refuge needs walking trails that are open year round."
"This refuge was an island in the middle of the Ohio River. From what we witnessed from the boat, it has lovely flora and fauna and mainly undisturbed because it is hard to get to except by boat. I like the situation because there is less disturbance thisway."
"This refuge was in very good condition"
"This survey is in regards to the south end boat ramp entrance. The launch ramps and parking lots need attention."
"This was one of the easier locations to find and travel too during our visit to Princeville, Kauai. We live in Glendale Arizona"
"Thought trails and routes could have been a bit better marked with distance."
"To be honest, I didn't pay attention since our guide did the driving and directing."
"To my knowledge there is only a short gravel road to a small parking area for this refuge. Perhaps I am wrong. We only kayaked but would intend to hike at another time."
"TOO MUCH RISK OF CAR BREAKINS IN PARKING LOT - BETTER MONITORING REQUIRED"
"Trail conditions were horrible. Wet, slippery, unsafe. I didn't stay long. But the road system getting there and parking were fine."
"Trail markings need to be kept in good condition and be written in clear language. At this refuge you can take a ""wrong"" turn and end up very much far away from where you intended to go."
"TRAILS & LOOPS WERE CLEARLY MARKED"
"TRAILS ARE COVERED BY GREENERY/BRUSHES, ETC. MORE IN RECENT YEARS. SEEMS MORE SECLUDED SAFTEY CONCERNS, THAN IN PAST YEARS. SAW A MAN LYING FACE DOWN IN THE GRASS, JUST OFF THE TRAIL W/NO SHIRT ON. I WAS ALONE AND DID NOT APPROACH. DOESN'T FEEL COMPLETLYSAFE. IT IS RARE TO SEE REFUGE EMPLOYEES EXCEPT DURING EVENTS."
"TRAILS ARE NOT MARKED, MILEAGES WOULD BE HELPFUL"
"Trails collect large pools of water which makes walking difficult."
"Trails for walking and hiking should be maintained better."
"Transportation-related features were not a major factor in our visit to the lighthouse & its surrounding area. It was a pretty straightforward tourist destination place for us, so the only item we noticed was less-than-obvious signage (OUTside the park)directing visitors to the Lighthouse & its parking. Once we found the ""major"" parking area, we had no more transportation issues."
"Transportation related features are all good."
"Trash container was marked as trash and recycling. This is not cool. They need to be separated."
"TURNING INTO & OUT OF THE REFUGE TO/FROM THE MAIN ROAD WAS LESS THAN IDEAL. THE TRAFFIC ON RT 2 WAS HEAVY & A TRAFFIC LIGHT WOULD BE/WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL."
"UNLESS YOU HAD 4 WHEEL DRIVE - ROAD TOO ROUGH TO GO VERY FAR."
"Use of concrete blocks/pavers is tough on vehicles but I understand why they are used; but they need repairs in some instances."
"Very convenient to the city. Wonderful resource especially for an urban area. This combination makes John Heinz unique"
"very easy to find parking! I was surprised, especially on a summer weekend."
"Very easy to get to since it in located in Philadlephia"
"Very enjoyable. I would recommend the visit."
"Very few parking spots at the entrance when the park is full and you are waiting to be allowed into the main parking area."
"VERY HAPPY WITH TRAILS THAT COULD EASILY BE ACCESSED WITH A STROLLER."
"VERY LIMITED IMPROVEMENTS WHICH AT THIS LOCATION IS NOT A PROBLEM. SIGNAGE COULD BE BETTER."
"Very little shore access for fishing and no shore access for disabled"
"VERY NICE & WELL KEPT FACILITIES! VERY CLEAN GROUNDS!"
"VERY NICE PARKING LOT, RECENTLY BLACK TOPPED. ITS GREAT"
"Very pleased with road conditions, cleaniness (no trash), visitor courtesy (never a problem with visitors). Very much dislike that some entrances have been closed that we have previously enjoyed traveling."
"Very pleased with the park. The park recently flooded, As soon the water receeded the park maintenance crew work exceptionally hard to get the roads passable, and all the debris picked up.."
"Very well maintained"
"VISITED ONLY ONE AREA OF THIS REFUGE. DO NOT KNOW CONDITION IN OTHER AREAS."
"Visitor center at Loess Bluffs is often closed on Sunday when we visit, so we rarely stop there."
"Walking trail by visitor center wasn't well marked and didn't have a direct walkway to it. Had to just figure it out & walk across grass to get to entrance for trail."
"walking trails are too restrictive during the fall and winter season."
"Was on the river on boat tour"
"WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO INTERPRETIVE DISPLAYS AND GIFT SHOP/BOOK STORE. 4 PM IS TOO EARLY TO CLOSE. BIRDWATCHING IS GOOD."
"Was very well maintained, a beautiful area. Wonderful for all ages with very impressive facilities"
"WATER FEATURE/POND IN PARKING AREA - LEAVING AN UNMOWED STRIP AROUND LITTORAL MARGIN OF POND WOULD ENHANCE SMALL WILDLIFE HABITAT."
"Water trails are narrow and get overgrown easily. Hard to navigate at times."
"We're getting to the age that access is becoming very important. Hiking no longer plays a large part in our birding trips."
"We access the Hanalei River from Hanalei Kayak's dock - a business. Was not aware on our paddle that we were in a refuge - did not see any signage."
"We are very happy with the parking areas in our refuge."
"We arrived on a Sunday and visitor center did not open until later. I believe weekends should be normal hours as expected."
"We both attended the lighthouse tour. It was very interesting & we enjoyed it. The only challenge we had is that the guide kept us on the 1st floor for an inordinate amount of time explaining things that he could have easily done outside. It was a very hot day. My wife had to leave before the tour completed & never got to see the top. His introduction was held outside in the shade where it was comfortable. He should have kept us out there longer."
"We cycled through the refuge, which was a very enjoyable experience."
"WE did not go into the refuge at all - only saw it from the boat"
"We did not know this was a refuge. No obvious signs. We noticed plates on the ground on the trail and figured it was an area managed by a government entity."
"We didn't expect it to be developed and don't want it to become overcrowded."
"WE DIDN'T SEE ANY ANIMALS EXCEPT 1 DEER AND PRAIRIE DOGS, NOT A HINT OF ANYTHING ELSE, DO DIDN'T NEED TO PULLOVER"
"We discovered the Preserve while driving through the area on our way to another destination. Loving wildlife and nature, we stopped for a short visit. We particularly enjoyed several short hikes and the wildlife (bison and deer, mostly. Thanks!"
"WE DON'T HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES BUT I DO CONSIDER THIS TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR PUBLIC LANDS"
"We enjoy camping and fishing here. Always a very good experience. However we feel there isn't enough parking at the boat ramp at wolf creek."
"WE ENJOY DRIVING SLOWLY ON THE AUTO DRIVE TO OBSERVE BIRDS AND TAKE PICTURES. SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO STOP AND OBSERVE WHEN OTHERS ARE DRIVING SO CLOSE TO YOUR CAR AND THERE ISN'T A PULL OFF. UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE NOT MORE PULL OFFS TO NOT DISTURB THE REFUGE."
"We enjoy going to the refuge."
"we enjoy the trails and go on a regular routine to get away from the daily grind. Its relaxing and love to show off our wildlife to visitors"
"We had no problem at this refuge."
"We had problems with one of the motor boats. Kept dying and had to restart often, gas leak at gas line. One employee at the boat rental site was very rude when we returned the boat. Okefenokee park"
"WE KNOW THIS REFUGE VERY WELL FROM MANY VISITS FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. WE DO NOT NEED ANY DISTRACTIONS OR DIRECTIONS"
"WE LIKE TO TAKE THE DRIVE ""SLOW"" TO ENJOY BIRDING, WILDLIFE AND PHOTOGRAPHY. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PLACES TO PULL OVER SAFELY TO LET FASTER VEHICLES GO BY. THE ACCESS TO THE BATGHROOMS ALONG A DIRT PATH UP A HILL TO THE ONE BATHROOM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TOO AT THE ENTRANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY WALKING."
"We like to visit the observation tower the most, but I feel that it could be better maintained."
"We live in Southern California and frequent refuges in our home county, Orange County. We went back home to Southern Louisiana and thoroughly enjoyed this refuge. It provided routes and access to a unique landscape, but was not over-guided - in other words it didnt feel like we were entering a tourist attaction, but more of a natural area that was perhaps protected. If we had not received your notice, we would not have known this area was a refuge. Best of luck with your research! Please contact me with any follow up questions: charmariemoreau@gmail.com"
"We love going to the island. It is beautiful and peaceful. I try to go every day that I can."
"We love the refuge and all the opportunities if provides for our family."
"We loved the boardwalk but our two year old kept tripping cause the walk way wasn't flat. Some boards where sticking up about 1/2 an inch."
"We made our first-ever and then our second visits to the refuge in the same week. Very easy to find (signs) and very easy to drive to."
"WE NEARLY MISSED THE SIGN TO THE CENTER BECAUSE IT WAS BLOCKED BY TREES, A LITTLE BIT. NEEDS TO BE A WARNING ITS COMING UP ON THE MAIN ROAD. SIGNS WERE KIND OF CONFUSING ON THE PARK. GPS HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT. THE LINK TO THE ADDRESS WAS YEARS OLD AND DIDN'T WORK SO WE HAD TO GUESS."
"WE NEED the ""no parking"" area enforced as EVERY weekend it is blocked by vehicles without boat trailers blocking the truck/trailer turn around forcing us to turn around at the top of the hill at the intersection and back completely down to the launch in the dark many times between numerous boat trailers etc. Not Good."
"We noticed that many people drive too quickly/aggressively on the refuge roads. This can lead to feeling rushed and unsafe."
"We only parked at the entrance & walked the trails. I'm not sure if there were roads going through the refuge for visitors. I think it's best that visitors just walk though."
"We pulled off on a road of rocks. There were no obvious parking. We then got lost trying to heap back to the interstate due to lack of signage."
"We rode bikes to the location, area had appropriate accommodations."
"We took an Uber."
"We travelled from Massachusetts and enjoyed the visit as part of our trip to the area of the Olympic National Park"
"We wanted to drive around more, but some roads were not paved."
"We went to the refuge after 2 days of heavy rain. Some trails were washed away. Also, there was no sign directing us. We observed the others hiking in the area for directions."
"WE WERE ABLE TO SAFELY RIDE NINJA MOTORCYCLE ON GRAVEL ROAD IN PARKING LOT. THANK YOU."
"We were driving from Maine to California and saw signs and about it. Decided to stop because I'm involved with water resources. You can see what I do at www.floodlimits.com Dean Wilkinson  Thanks for everything! If I can be of help to you let me know."
"We were here shortly after the burn so about half the hike was charred landscape. It was still nice, though."
"We were in vans with guides so we did not have to navigate on our own. I did not see much signage if we were driving around finding our own way."
"We were not allowed out of the car for any reason (as stated firmly by the volunteer in the booth) Made taking photos a bit tough"
"We were there in winter for a short hike/walk with small kids. The outing was perfect for that occasion. We did not really require much by way of parking space or physical infrastructure (good road surface or well-developed paths)."
"We were unable to hike entire trail since part of it was closed due to boardwalk being unstable"
"we were very satisfied by all aspects of this experience."
"WE WERE WALKING SO MANY QUESTIONS DIDN'T APPLY!"
"We would have stayed longer but there was a large photography group there taking up all the parking"
"We would like Ottawa to have the auto route open at all times the refuge is open (as at many other NWRs with such auto routes)."
"Well-maintained hiking trail including seasonal trail. Ties into non-refuge dike trail near Columbia River."
"WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT NO PAVED ROADS? WE CAN GET AROUND & THAT IS IMPORTANT:)"
"When the roads are underwater, often for several weeks at a time, I don't visit at all."
"WHEN WE WERE THERE IN MAY, THE ROADS WORE TORN UP. NO BENCHES ON THE WALKING TRAILS-WHICH IS A BAD THING, HOLES IN ROAD WALKING AREAS. THE 2 TIMES WE TRIED IN SEPT & OCT YOU WER CLOSED AND NO INFO ABOUT THAT UNTIL WE GOT THERE"
"WHEN YOU KILL A DEER I WISH THEY WOULD ALLOW ATV-UTV USAGE TO BRING OUT THE DEER. BUT NOT TO USE FOR TRANSPORTATION TO & FROM YOUR STAND FOR RETRIEVAL ONLY!"
"WHERE BRICK WATERWAY IS HAS TOOK IT'S WEAR ON MY VEHICLE. SO THAT AREA SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD BE GREAT"
"While I appreciate the absence of auto traffic, I don't understand why one cannot walk from the parking area rather than riding the shuttle bus."
"While I don't have issues with hunting, the value of refuges for non-hunting visitors is becoming increasingly important, so management of refuge resources and permitting access to areas for non-hunting people, along with education would be pretty great."
"While kayaking on the Concord, Sudbury, Assabet it would be EXTREMELY helpful if all the bridges were maked so I would know where I am. I have traveled from Billerica, to Bedford, to Concord as far as Carlisle and DO NOT know where I am when traveling under bridges except for bridge indicating I've reached Carlisle. There are no markers as to town or road you are on when passing under these many bridges."
"While we did not use the tram, its availability cuts down number of vehicles on refuge roads, makes the refuge more accessible, and provides useful information to visitors."
"Wildlife Drive is extremely rough"
"Wish the access road was covered with something quieter than gravel for walking, but I can understand that you need the gravel for the vehicles."
"Wish we had access by car to Lake Erie shoreline"
"Witnessed a nene killed by a motorist. Wonder if that is a frequent occurance and if it is being addressed."
"wonderful staff! We were asked if we had questions and were shown several things that we had not expected."
"Wooded access, no signs on access road. Know only from knowledge"
"Word of mouth is the best pr for the refuge"
"Would be nice if there were more places to pull off on the auto route, River ""S"" Unit. For those of us who like to photograph wildlife it would be great not to hold up non-photography traffic when we see something of interest."
"Would be nice if we could get out to some of the pools farther away from the main road."
"Would be nice to a have a loop road that could be driven and have pull outs available."
"WOULD LIKE A CYCLE TRACK ALONSIDE WALKING TRAILS"
"Would like for the auto tour to be open more often."
"WOULD LIKE MORE ACCESS TO RESTROOMS DURING THE AUTOTOUR"
"Would like more observation areas to view wildlife"
"WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ACCESS TO SOME ADDITIONAL TRAILS."
"Would like to see more employers on premises due to trail to wildlife very isolated - concern for safety."
"would like to see more liking trails at the both Ridgefield units"
"WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE PULL OFFS FOR PICTURE TAKING"
"Would like to see more rangers/sheriffs patrolling. People parking in handicap spots instead of parking where they are suppose to. I am handicapped and can not walk long distances. Just makes me mad when go to park in handicap spot and taken by someone not handicapped, just lazy!"
"Would like to see the driving roads open year round at Ottawa. I'm old and can't walk for long spurts."
"Would love for some signage to indicate which trails are out-and-back vs. loop, and, possibly, the distance from that sign to the Welcome Center."
"YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR TOURISM IN oHIO! tHANKS"
"YOU DON'T DRIVE IN THIS REFUGE YOU WALK"
