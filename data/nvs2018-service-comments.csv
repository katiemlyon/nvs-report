"1. Bathrooms needed 2. Kayaks. Landing for kayak in the refuge instead of the boat landing. Boat landing is too much boat traffic. Grass is too high. We get ticks and chigger bites when we visit the birds."
"1. Staff great! 2. Concern about chemical spray weed car trail."
"1. Would like to see visitors center open 7 days a week for visitors experience & questions. 2. Bathrooms closed for plumbing issues 2 to 3 times a year, need a long term fix 3. Water fountains down for long stretches of time, like to drink before & afterhike 4. For 6 monts of year main part of refuge where birds are is closed. I understand why & looking for eompromise to protecty birds and allow better bird watching on flyway."
"2 trips in 2 years , both times gov shutdown made it very hard and could not enjoy all that was to offer, wish you could find a way to stay open when 150 folks from all over come to visit"
"4                                   5                                   1"

"999+"
"A canoe launch would be very nice addition - to the river bordering the refuse."
"A couple more observation decks/towers might be nice.....most times in winter, the waterfowl are pretty far away from the road due to the way the berms are set up so it is difficult to see them. A good tower might facilitate good viewing along the road.or, maybe a bridge type blind that goes from the road to the inner berms would help the viewers but not scare the birds too much."
"A great area for the local community, no where else nearby can provide the views of birds and wildlife. Visiting is always a welcome break from big city life. I especially love being able to watch wildlife over the change of the seasons during the year atthe refuge"
"A great place to check out urban wildlife without going too far from home. You never know what you may see depending on time of day or season of the year. Have learned a lot here."
"A little more effort in the maintenance of the restrooms would be greatly appreciated."
"A nicer restroom or additional port-a-jon would be nice. Maybe have it only open during island access hours and closed after hours to prevent theft or vandalism."
"A platform to overview the marsh would be a welcomed asset"
"A restroom at the kiwa trailhead would be good."
"A restroom would be helpful in the parking lot"
"A restroom would be nice."
"A restroom would be very welcome."
"A shade structure would have been nice. We went there to see the lighthouse and there was very little information on it. The photographs on the walls were sun faded and located in places where if someone was sitting and watching a video, you couldn't seeit/them."
"A small restaurant would be nice here."
"A trash can would be helpful to keep people from littering"
"A treasure in our own backyard thank you"
"A very nice experience overall."
"A very nice gift shop as well as very nicely maintained grounds."
"A very nice refuge that could be made much better with a little more money for improvements."
"A wind barrier will greatly improve the bike trail due to high winds from the ocean making this trail very unenjoyable, even though the bike path itself is wondereful. Friends and i are often discouraged from using the bike trail because of this reason."
"A wonderfully serene and beautiful place to come to relax with nature. Sitting on the rocks listening to the waves and bird calls is a meditation."
"Above all the park is very well maintained."
"Absolutely loved ottawa new nature center"
"Access road closed to public"
"Add a bathroom"
"Additional restroom facilities along driving loop would be nice. Even porta-potties."
"Additional trails would be useful. Lookout towers would be nice too. Perhaps a trail that leads to a lookout tower."
"After my boys youth hunt we all had a very wonderful experience. This was my twin boys first duck hunt. It will be a life long memory for all of us. You did a great job."
"Again, any questions related to activities outside of one's car don't apply here."
"Again, my only comment is to add minutes to return to lot, knowing everyone walks differently, but even putting a % that you are around the loop wouldn't make sense as i lost track of when i was on the path vs on extension trails. Overall, extremely impressed with this facility and very impressed that this survey was being collected while i, myself, was conducting a form of research at the college level!! Good luck to all!"
"Again, recycling and trash need to be separated"
"Again, since i just boated around the island, i don't know about anything except the young man who spoke to us on the boat about the refuge."
"Again, the boat ramps and no handicap access. The docks are minimal at best. We were told years ago that there would be new ones but that hasn't happened. The wardens seem to be pretty decent but we don't really see any of the others. Next time the lake level goes down rebuild those ramps. There's no reason to put off designing a handicap access plan for the lake."
"Again, the facility was closed the day we went and could not do anything than visit the visitor center. Very disappointing."
"Again, this is our favorite refuge. But that said, i always want more refuges, more opportunities to birdwatch and hike in nature. I worry about the refuge getting overcrowded with people who aren't serious about nature as the town of ridgefield gets bigger. That's where i believe educational opportunities and volunteer opportunities can help. We love ridgefield and always enjoy our time spent there. We drive from beaverton and i would say we go at least one time a month."
"Airboat tours as currently airboats used by invasive species removal. Would appreciate gps map for download to assist in mapping fishing locations"
"All great!"
"All i do is fish and 8 years ago ti was good fishing i don't know where the fish went. I own 3 kayaks so i am taking people all the time. At the moment there are 3 osprey nests so it is a good time to go if you get there at about 6:45 you can watch them catch fish."
"All staff were very pleasant to visit with"
"All the people at visitor center and campground check-in were courteous and professional."
"All the place is, is a place to drop a small boat in. No docks, no trails, no restrooms etc. Just a spot off the road with an open area to drop a small boat off."
"All the seniors in my group were extremely pleased with everything to the point that we are already planning another one for next year"
"All the staff at this refuge are friendly and professional"
"Almost everything we encountered at the refuge appeared to be well maintained & in good condition. As mentioned in a previous comment, one of the wood boardwalk areas was slippery due to shade and dampness."
"Although there are two signs ""no pets"" many people walk their dogs. You do run into alligators walking, about which could bring about a dangerous situation."
"Always enjoy visiting blackwater - we have been coming here for 10 years as our grandchildren live in the area. Has always been a pleasant experience. Would like to see more programs for older children."
"Amaze balls"
"Areas that are not around the visitor center (i.e. Lake road) needs a well maintained bathroom by the boat launch. Bayou adventure in lacombe is a very import place for information, kayak rentals, information, groceries and supplies."
"As a member of save the bay and appalachians mtn. Club, i understand the difficulty of trail maintenence, they have recently done work on erosion control, creating rock/funnel water bars very well. Railroad wood/gravel bars, are needed!!"
"As a retiree if costs of my visit were to be implemented, my visit would decrease. With a limited budget, i enjoy the opportunity to do what i enjoy--nearby hiking and bird watching. Thank you for providing this."
"As a senior (83) i value local places that are convenient to walk and get exercise."
"As above, please maintain and reopen all of the oaks-to-wetlands trail, including the seasonal sections. I'm also excited to learn about the carty lake trail extension!"
"As stated before, only concerns about access to the island once bridge work starts."
"As stated earlier. Our group of 3 vehicles on a texas exploration trip stopped here on a sunday morning :00am is. The visitors center was not open and did not open for a few hours. I think on weekends the center should have had normal business hours."
"As the popularity of the refuge has increased so too have the amount of visitors who may not be well versed in the ways of acceptable behavior. It is my belief that the refuge should be staffed year around at all times during hours of operation to provideassistance and educate those who may need direction on proper etiquette."
"As this refuge is adjacent to a river, there might be opportunities to have a dock for people that might want to kayak to it."
"At least on restroom would be a good addition. Additonal observation decks/blinds would be great."
"At shiawassee national wildlife refuge i wish the wildlife drive would be open before june 1 and after september 30. May would be a great time to use the wildlife drive!! Also, i wish more habitat could be managed for shorebirds."
"At some places the wood board on the refugee roads need to be inspected for tripping hazards. My overall experience is great. By they way i have two beehives with bees and i believe visitor would be excited if they can see at least one hive with bees 20 to 30 feet apart from the refugee road. Bees and beekeeping are related to the mother of the nature.  Thank you, ico sulejmanagic"
"At the desert national wildlife refuge i would like to know how far it was to a look out point. They were unsure on what cars & trucks would make the trail without getting stuck."
"At the location i usually use for fishing there is no restroom, kinda sucks, but the location is not the best neighborhood. But where the trail head locations are at are great! Those places have nice restrooms and visitor kiosks."
"At the title there were not very many birds available at the refuge"
"At this particular refuge, i think usfws has offered everything they can. It's a great place to take my family on a gentle hike."
"Availability of kayak rentals on sundays is limited"
"Bailey tract at ding darling is beautiful and diverse; trails are not well marked."
"Bare bones facility"
"Bathroom not fixed"
"Bathroom was nasty"
"Bathrooms (pit toilets) need attention more frequently"
"Bathrooms are disgusting! Rarely, if ever, cleaned. Very gross"
"Bathrooms are never very clean and are always guarded by tarantula hawks because of the plant life in front of the bathrooms.jokes aside, last time i wasn't able to use the restrooms because of all the wasps but the few times i have used it i almost didn't because of the lack of cleanliness."
"Bathrooms are often pretty nasty. One reason is that there are no garbage cans in the entire place! Crazy!"
"Bathrooms at the trailhead would be helpful/nice."
"Bathrooms were terrible. A better map would help indicate that you can't do a complete ""loop hike"" on one of the paths around the water areas that have a land bridge across it. Provide easier ways to pay the fee - via venmo, paypal, etc. People rarely have cash on them or checques these days. Make this survey easier to take and on the spot, making it this difficult means you are only getting a particular type of respondent, potentially skewing results"
"Bathrooms would have been nice"
"Bayou lacombe doesn't have volunteers, restrooms, visitor center, etc."
"Beautiful but small refuge"
"Beautiful hiking trail"
"Beautiful views"
"Beautiful wildlife experience"
"Because an eagle nest nearby, a major leap trail is closed much of the year. Though i know the wildlife's needs come first, i believe a small section of one trail that leads for an observation pier could be kept open without disturbing the eagle."
"Because this is a relatively small area a lot of these activities and facilities are just not practical. I think for what it is, they do a good job."
"Because we stay in our cars, the bird watching is amazing. I would be very sorry if there were people biking on the auto trail. The car acts as a bird blind. Because of the car, i have seen a horned owl up close, a red tailed hawk eating a bird, deer grazing by my car, a blue heron eating a frog, and on the list goes. The animals are not disturbed by a car. I have never seen so much wildlife in my outings before, because people scare the animals. Keep the auto trail for cars. No bikes, no hikers. Thanks!"
"Best kayaking in the area"
"Best restrooms in the area. Happy when the auto tour is open, but sad when it is not"
"Best walking opportunity in our area - excellent bird watching"
"Better bathrooms for handicap."
"Better kept trails & landscaping would be nice, very pleasant. Notification of events. Not sure if it still takes place but annual tour, hot dogs, and other animals, pariots, owls, snakes & other exotic birds was an event we used to look forward to."
"Better restroom"
"Better signage from highway"
"Better signage is needed on some of the trails."
"Better signage toward end of trail would be very helpful. My party and a few others got turned around before the finish."
"Better signs for quiet around rockey bathrooms at parking area would be nice."
"Better than expected."
"Better than i expected. Clean bathrooms. Interesting interpreted boat ride through swamplands"
"Big game hunting days should be extended. Muzzle loading and rifle."
"Bike rental opportunities. Bathrooms at wolf creek causeway upgraded."
"Birding before 9 am opening of park office a bit inconvenient. Access to restrooms and information"
"Birding is very good, but with all of the herbicides and extreme trimming, it is losing ground. The refuge will be rearranged somewhat to all remeandering of chicken creek. That will wipe out opportunities to see unique and specific birds in places wherethey return yearly."
"Birdwatching is best in the morning, the visitor center did not open until noon on the weekends . We did not go to the visitor center because we were already done for the day."
"Boardwalk on mahnomen trail at sherburne nwf has hole from broken board that is a hazard and needs repair. I notified staff of problem nearly 2 weeks ago and repair not done."
"Boat dock is not handicap accessible parking next to the water should not be allowed"
"Boat launch is good."
"Boat ramp conditions are very poor and unkept. I see no reason to block boating and fishing from the western half of the refuge."
"Boat ramp is not well-maintained. Kayak water trails would be nice (or maps of where to this if it already exists). Garbage can desperately needed at boyscout road trailhead."
"Boat ramp was in terrible shape"
"Boat ramps are in need of upgrading. Some have huge holes underwater"
"Boat ramps in need of replacement, north & south side ramp."
"Boat rentals would be nice to see/$$opportunity"
"Boaters badly need a sea wall to break the wave action when winds are from the north or east especially when the tide is high. Sometimes it's almost impossible to load my boat on the trailer because of heavy seas.  We also need the 'no parking' area painted in yellow on the blacktop so the idiots that cannot read either sign that is posted will be able to see the yellow diagonal no parking stripes in the area needed to turn a full size truck/dual axle trailer around in order to launch."
"Brush along the water canals on swamp drive need cutting down so can see into waterways canals etc. Sometimes trees fall in road and are left there"
"Building exists for schools groups not open to public - use for naturalists with displays etc. Open 7 days (get rid of some maintenance to defer costs)"
"Called visitors center for map, they had them. Asked forms of payment, agreed to come buy one. Drove there person said cannot sell them to me. That is a function of friends of crab orchard. Why this was not brought to my attention while on the phone sincei said i was on my way at the time!"
"Center was closed after 4 pm on labor day weekend"
"Centersshould be open on weekends during spring migration and erly summer"
"Choice to go here often driven because i know there's a bathroom available, even in winter."
"Circle tour has only 1 bathroom that a disabled person can use. The other one you have to walk quite aways. Being a one way road is hard on disabled."
"Clean restrooms, knowledgeable staff volunteers, interpretative programs offered. I come often & even before staff or volunteers are there i'm used to being there - so i call that ""feeling welcome"""
"Concerned about noise from nearby highway. It takes some of the wilderness character away.   Would be great to have a paddle craft boat launch somewhere convenient within the refuge."
"Corey invited me to view the semi-annual pup fish count at devils hole. Very interesting."
"Corn creek area very well maintained and nice. Back country areas less well maintained (roads) and somewhat of an impediment for visiting. Condition of roads needs better signage - can vary greatly due to weather / maintenance variability from month to month."
"Corn creek used to be a premier bird watching location. But the field station at the refuge has been very poorly manages. The pond habitat has becaome a disasterous mistake. And vegetation has been very poorly managed as well"
"Could not use the toilet facilities due to filth on several occasions"
"Could use a nicer restroom.  I feel that very few of the volunteers ever leave the visitors center and go into the refuge."
"Crab orchard lake is heavily patrolled on the water during summer months by refuge law enforcement. For the relatively low amount of boaters, as compared to other nearby lakes, this seems excessive. I'm aware that this refuge is the training facility forlaw enforcement for all other national wildlife refuges. It seems that users of this refuge are subject to excessive law enforcement so the users can be part of the training program. This is unfair and unwelcoming. Also, the refuge is overgrown with an invasive plant species, russian olive, also called autumn olive. These large bushes are taking over many areas visible from the roads. As owner of 10 acres, i'd hate to own property adjacent to the refuge due to the difficulty of fighting these species. Asa member of the public, i find it wasteful and careless that these bushes are being allowed to become so pervasive. Funds need to be redirected from excessive law enforcement toward eradication of invasive plant species such as russian olive."
"Crab orchard wildlife refuge is superbly managed, staffed, and maintained. We have never had anything but a wonderful experience when we've spent time in its boundaries over the last 20 years. It was one of the major reasons we relocated to southern illinois! We own a home that is in close proximity to it and we never tire of exploring and enjoying all that it has to offer."
"Day use area only has one restroom near small parking lot. Both could be enlarges to support number of people visiting at peak periods."
"Dedicated cc shi trails in winter trails are destroyed by hikers, dogs, horses and their waste."
"Deeply appreciate this NWR. The work they're doing to protect golden checked warbler, black capped vireo habitat. Having it nearby w/ the opportunity it provides to get out into nature is very important to my fa"
"Deer season should be 2 weeks later"
"Delightful day viewing wild life"
"Did not use any of the services or facilities on the refuge. I used the hunting and fishing opportunities within the refuge."
"Didn't see as many birds as last time (2013). Somewhat disappointing."
"Disappointed in the limited trail system in the refugee. It appeared to me that there were so many more areas to hike than what was actually available. Wasn't worth the drive."
"Disatisfied with the lack of garbage cans to put trash in"
"DNWR has fantastic facilities well worth a visit and will be returning in the future. Extending the trails would be interesting and perhaps the driving into the wilderness could be slightly easier for day trippers wanting to do this? Realise this comes ata cost though to revamp tracks and also you'd need to restrict numbers also perhaps wanting to do this?"
"Doesn't need to be over developed. Let wild spaces be wild."
"Drinking water would be nice to have available. A group of kids tried to get fresh water across the street at the ymca, but were denied by the staff. Possibly a restroom."
"Due to bluff erosion the trails (foot paths) are continually undergoing, redirection, some thought should be considered to wind the through foliage and not just make it a straight shot foot path. More benches, lookouts, picnic tables for day use should beinstalled."
"Due to the government shutdown, no restrooms were available, and the visitor's center was not open."
"Dungeness NWR is an amazing unique place which we visit every summer on our annual trip to sequimi. We love it and it deserves all the support it can get."
"Employees always knowledgable and helpful. The refuge is great. The hunting season is very painful for everyone and everything except the for the few hunters. Why again must we tolerate hunting there? It is barbaric and disturbingly loud. I'm sure that the locals including ourselves would be more than happy to contribute financially in order to eliminate the need for hunters. Thanks for the opportunity for imput."
"Employees on the boat were very helpful (including the ohio state workers)"
"Enjoyed everything"
"Enjoyed hiking trail - photo opportunities were great - saw 2 deer feeding in marsh, owl on tree and an osprey."
"Enjoyed my visit there"
"Enjoyed the trails. At one point it was unclear if a trail was closed for conservation or not (sign about 1/4 mile down the trail, not at the trail head)"
"Environmental education and access to outdoor recreation (trails, kayaking, wildlife viewing) is more important now, than ever. Crab orchard national wildlife refuge provides excellent opportunities for all of these activities!"
"Every time there is a new class of graduating wildlife and fishery agents, they harass the local and visiting fisherman. We don't appreciate them focusing and training on our area more than other areas."
"Every visit to dwr & its other sites has always been terrific. My family spends a lot of time there due to its remoteness. This allows my family with a local back to nature day & overnight trip close to home."
"Everyone was friendly and nice."
"Everyone was helpful and friendly."
"Everyone who works at the reduge is so friendly and knowledgeable. It is a pleasure to visit john hines"
"Everything about this place is excellent!"
"Everything was appropriate for the location"
"Excellent"
"Excellent"
"Excellent education facility! My son has been coming here for school field trips for the past 3 years and it's been a great experience for us."
"Excellent facilities, including ding darling refuge visitor center and tarpon bay facility. Opportunity to paddle, bike, fish were excellent. We visited the facilities three times and would have a fourth but the visitor center closed due to government shutdown during our visit which we discovered when we arrived."
"Excellent facility, well cared for and an excellent visitor center.  Very clean and well maintained restrooms. All trails are in excellent condition. The entire refuge is very well maintained."
"Excellent maintained"
"Excellent maintenance and friendly staff"
"Excellent refuge. Very important wild life resource. Deserves continued funding."
"Expand opportunities and areas to hunt small game such as grey and fox squirrels, rabbits, quail, and doves."
"Explain who was whispering ben!!! You have a trail dedicated to a paiute elder named whispering ben, but then you have no background story!!! It sounds like it was a joke of the paiutes whom consulted on the creation of the trail"
"Extremely disappointed visitor center, gift shop did not even have a bottle of water for sale. It was very hot and should have had some sort of fluid available."
"Extremely friendly staff"
"Extremely welcome & beautiful. We walk the paths once a week."
"Fabulous refuge. Loved biking and hiking a bike path so one is not riding on large gravel would be wonderful."
"Facilities are awesome!"
"Facilities not extensive, but very nice for a low-impact observational visit."
"Facilities were well maintained and in great shape"
"Facility & staff were excellent"
"Facility small and price was a little high"
"Fantastic public boat launch. Our specific visits here are for access to our second home which is only accessible via boat. But we do tour & visit other refugees for other recreational purposes."
"Favorite place on earth!! So beautiful! Very lucky to live so close to sachuest point!!"
"Federal game warden was great!"
"Festival brochure on website not clear. Wished i had signed up for evening bird events. Often birds are active in early morning hours, no events or volunteers early!"
"Few spots specifically set up for viewing scenery or wildlife. Growth along roads specifcally made to view wildlife obscuring many viewpoints of scenic or wildlife areas. More foot path access to scenic or wildlife viewing areas needed."
"Fill the road and parking lot would be a huge improvement"
"Fishing areas blocked by fallen trees"
"Fishing dock closed on second visit. Overall a special place . You can't have enough opportunities to be in and among nature. Very important for all ages especially children."
"For a few of the questions i marked not at all satisfied because i wish this refuge did not allow hunting. I go to watch the very birds the hunters are killing and it's very upsetting, especially when the birds are having such a tough time as it is withclimate change. The gun shots are quite disturbing when trying to have a peaceful, enjoyable, wildlife viewing experience."
"For a small trail area there was lots to see! A bird refuge, signs about what certain plants were, a nice bridge spanning over the river (not the historical sweetwater bridge but a wooden one further in on the trail). We even saw an owl scoping out some prey! Facilities aren't always important because if there's too much bustling it scares away the wildlife who are supposed to live there. More decks or platforms for getting views would always be welcome though."
"For my purposes on this trip everything suited me fine."
"For our picknicking, walking and bird watching, pinkney was a delightful day trip."
"For such a large water inpoundment area the areas open to fishing are almost non existant. Very disappointing."
"Friendly people and interaction with children. Welcome/nature center closed mondays 8 rules out trips on long weekends or holiday mondays."
"Friendly staff. small visitor center but really liked the educational component with local artifacts and animal remains (skeletons, skulls, teeth)"
"Friends of balcones were absolutely fantastic!"
"Fyi this survey is way to long and repetitive. People will either tire and rush through or (like me) not complete. You need a two page survey. You are attempting to gather too much info. I am a volunteer at great meadows wildlife preserve in concord. Ma"
"Gals asking about this survey is the only people we saw, they were nice."
"Generally satisfied with this facility. More turnouts to spend stationary time in and let traffic pass would be an improvement."
"Gift shop was shut down, no one ask if i needed help in the visitor center and also no drinking water available for us or the dog. this site has gone very downhill since i last visit the site."
"Gorgeous beach. Loved spending the day there."
"Graven road potholes can be dangerous at times when you are w3atching other things"
"Great"
"Great local multi-use resource in urban area w/easy access to several towns/ communities; however having limited access to all refuge roads from oct.1 through april 30 is a drawback for me personally since the remaining trails do not offer enough open space to walk & explore away from other visitors."
"Great meadows wildlife reguge has been a place of solace and enrichment for which i am very grateful."
"Great morning and evening walk! We do it often."
"Great opportunities to get close to la wetlands"
"Great place to visit as it is. Not all touristy and full of glitter. It is natural."
"Great place to visit to see wildlife and just enjoy nature itself peaceful place to go"
"Great properties, great staff,  i have always enjoyed my visits to the balcones canyonlands refuge over the last 15 years"
"Great site for the birds"
"Great staff at center!!!"
"Great visit, but the restrooms needed servicing!! :)"
"Great visitor center facilities"
"Great volunteers; helpful and courteous. The displays were informative and impressive!"
"Great!!"
"Group who introduced the survey were very nice, although no well informed about the refuge, since they were traveling around the northeast to conduct the interviews"
"Had been here many years before. a convenient place to walk and enjoy scenery on way between port angeles and pt. Townsend"
"Hate to see hunting. I like seeing the wildlife."
"Having just spent 2.5 hours there (for the 1st time) walking with a friend, i did not leave with the awareness that all these other options were available...biking, fishing, hunting, visiting visitor center, birding, etc. Either i was not looking for signs and missed them, or they did not show up on my path."
"Heinz is a big part of my life. It's existence and vitality is very important to me."
"Hiking trails clear of weeds, poison ivy"
"Homelessness is bad in the area. Keeping this problem contained outside the refuge is very important."
"Hours of operation, handling of reservations, and cost were really problematic. The refuge itself and the educational visitor center was great. Cost for one night was well over $150 which is outrageous for a family."
"Hunting in progress signs should be put up during hunting seasons so hunters are not harassed by people (ignorant to refuge, maps, rules, regulations, hunting, fishing, or scouting)."
"Hunting is my primary reason for visiting the refuge"
"Hunting on the preserve is ridiculous! I didn't know how many times we have been towed away because big strong men with large guns were blamming away at defense-less creatures. Wtf?"
"Hunting permit system does not give everyone a fair chance. People with no access to internet or people who do't know how to use internet have no chance."
"Hunting season closes the wildlife drive and a few trails some months in the fall. Would be nice to have it open at least a little during that time."
"Hunting should not be allowed on the refuge"
"Hunting trails need to be cleared of down trees and bush hog!"
"Hunting: when i only had weekends to visit the refuge, it frustrated me that the refuge would close for hunting only on weekends - maybe the hunts should be thurs-sat leaving sunday for other visitors. Refuge staff is generally very accommodating and thefriends of hagerman NWR provide excellent programs and activities"
"I'd like opportunities to visit areas closer to the columbia river that are available to hunters during the winter, but are not available to the public during the summer. Purchasing an advanced level pass would be a possible way to make this happen."
"I'd like to see a few short trail segments added in places to enhance birding opportunities in the open tidal flats. Right now, most birds are located at long distances away from the main hiking trail."
"I'm 80 and the fishing piers make this place ideal for an old fisherman. I felt like i had died and gone no heaven when i saw the fishing opportunities. Thank you for making it possible to have a place to fish without fear of falling."
"I'm answering questions about a bike trail around san diego and various wildlife preserves, which doesn't allow hunting or have a visitor center."
"I'm by the bayside area walk/bike path. A lot of these questions don'tpertain to this area. It's still very nice to have locally."
"I'm disappointed in how drastically they raised the price of lifetime passes for seniors."
"I'm excited to learn that a new visitor's center is to be built!"
"I'm from philly and have never visited john heinz (before the day a friend and i decided to go on a walk there). Such beautiful nature and wildlife so close to the city - it would be great to make it super accessible from the city (paths to connect from the city to the refuge, public transportation that goes directly from the city to the refuge, etc)"
"I'm not sure of any opportunities to volunteer...but that may probably be my own fault as i didn't go to the visitor center to ask. Oops."
"I've never beeen able to drive up to the visitor center because the gate has always been closed. I admit i haven't completely checked that out."
"I've not yet entered the visitor's center, but i did meet a staff member outside of the visitor's center who was extremely courteous, and i have called the visitor's center for information."
"I've only visiteed the visitor center of the tualatin wildlife refuge twice. Each time, the volunteer behind the desk was engaging, friendly and i left having learned something new!"
"I've visited balcones canyon lands twice in hopes of seeing the golden checked warbler but haven't spotted one yet. Maybe signs on where best to see would help."
"I've visited prime hook many times over the past 10 years or so. A few years ago the hurricane wiped out a lot of the natural habitat and with this most recent visit i was pleased to see that nature is starting to rebuild the water ways, etc. A couple years ago i had stopped by to kayak and everything was pretty much bone dry. Nothing that can be done about that but let nature take it's course, just wanted to mention it here that i'm glad to see it's coming back."
"I've visited twice - the employees are very friendly and helpful. Lovely observation decks - i'd love to bring a large group here to picnic. I'm a former scout leader."
"I [name] do enquire that you would keep the new johnsonville refuge entrance gate open all the time this includes night time!!! This is very important!!!"
"I always stop at the desk to ask what i can see, i call ahead for the drive through to be sure i will be open if weather could be a factor. Everyone is always very helpful"
"I am a birdwalk leader at this refuge. The staff are always helpful and supportive."
"I am a docent for the coastal discovery museum and do guided nature walks here. There are no restrooms and we sure could use them at pinckney. Also, they took the port a potties away at savannah national wildlife refuge and we really need them back! Myfriends and i often spend 6 hours there and we need our restrooms."
"I am a social worker. I took a client to the refuge to calm down and relax. We sat in the car which was surrounded by serene nature. I live within 3 miles of a different refuge and had never been to this one."
"I am happy they put the care trail in the refuge, been walking it for many years."
"I am not really sure we were at the visitor center. We came specifically for the friends of balcones birding festival. They had port-a-potties, not my favorite bathroom experience and other than one place i don't think there were any other restrooms. Thatwould be the biggest concern for me."
"I am not sure why such large areas near bald eagle nests need to be closed off from even foot use since the two bald eagle nests in the parking lots next door at magee marsh have extensive foot and auto traffic which does not seem to bother the birds whohave chosen to nest there year after year."
"I am opposed to the strict no off-trail access for visitors other than hunters!"
"I am quite surprised to be asked to do a survey because this site is so underdeveloped"
"I am unhappy with how the goose hunting ground blind sites have been eliminated. I do like that ducks have been added to the hunting opportunity."
"I am usually there when eh staff has left for the day but when they are there they are very helpful"
"I am very happy kayaking on the river. I start at the boat ramp in bedford and either head toward lowell and have also travelled the sudbury and assabet. So much more to see and try out. A friend meets me from foxboro; i travel from wilmington. It's a great place for meeting for the all of us."
"I am very pleased at the conditions of this park. I like that it is not crowded with people and that the platforms and boardwalk are in good condition. I have no interest in fishing.  The visitor's center is lovely and the bathrooms are clean.  I am concerned about the water and air quality of the area but the park is so close to metro philadelphia that i am not sure what else they can do to remediate the situation."
"I appreciate extra auto tour open dates. Would like access to drive down shorebird habitat during spring & fall migrations"
"I appreciate that the deer hunting lottery is limited to 40 to maximize the chances of a big buck and not running the deer out of the refuge; however, unfortunately, i have never been selected in the lottery to hunt on the refuge."
"I arrived 4 hours early to secure a good dove hunting position. Just 20 minutes before the birds started flying, three different groups of other hunters showed up at the last minute and horned into areas around the field so that i was left with no shooting lanes that were not shooting towards people. A complete waste of my time. Never again. This situation needs to be managed since people have no ethics or common sense."
"I believe all people should have the opportunity to visit and enjoy this (and all) national wildlife refuges for free. There should be no barrier to participate. It is our land and our taxes should fund them."
"I belong to daughters of the american revolution and was looking for conservation material-pamphlets etc. Your staff was very helpful."
"I came to the refuge to photograph birds. It's a new hobby that i've taken up in the past year. This trip was my most successful. I saw herons and warblers and woodpeckers and ducks and swans and catbirds and red-winged blackbirds and honestly, i'm probably forgetting some more. I saw that people had been kayaking at the refuge before i arrived. I noticed a programming schedule that offered educational and active opportunities. The visitor's center was welcoming and clean and interesting. The trails wereclear and accessible, and i shared them with joggers, walkers and cyclists alike. I believe the refuge is a gem in philadelphia that we are lucky to have, and i think those who work to make it what it is deserve a great deal of gratitude."
"I came to visit on a day when the visitor's center was closed. I really appreciated that restrooms were still accessible. Thank you for keeping them open!"
"I can't remember the sign at the beginning of the trail, but i like it when they list the potential animals in the area & info about them."
"I could not find any services, facilities or opportunities at this refuge. It has great potential but i doubt anything will happen. Word of mouth was it is a dangerous/crime area."
"I did not check or ask, but a list of volunteer opportunities at the refuge or on the website would be swell. The refuge is a wonderful place and i will definitely be back."
"I didn't find out about the rest of the area until after i left . I was reading the book i bought and found out the rest of the area. I made a short stop there on my way to florida, a saturday afternoon/ sunday morning tour of the area. The only resultsfrom my internet search was the refuge and park. I could have brought my boat and spent several days there."
"I didn't see any picnic tables along the trail."
"I do not agree with logging in the refuge 2 also think - people should be allowed to have designated walking paths not just for hunters. Thank you"
"I do not receive information about volunteer opportunities. I'd like to! I am a local teacher, mom & grandmother - never hear about education programs for adults or kids here. I don't know of any outreach to bridgeport schools or others nearby to encourage trips or education."
"I do not use your bath room, made out of plastic and looks like its for small people. put more checking in station for hunter than two on the east side. How come you cant put checking station with the welcome center area or at the duck over look? Moreaccess to gtr 1 instead of river road , this area is closed every wednesday and saturday morning, plus every time the river comes out of its banks. I'm not asking for much, but to be treated fairly like the people using the area connecting people with nature { what i'm i }"
"I do think they should install some public restroom facilities near the parking area. Also the signs for the entrance can be easily missed as one couple missed the turnoff and almost missed the tour with the vo"
"I don't feel hunting should be aloud on island due to safety of hikers and runners on the road."
"I don't know how we could get closer to birds w/o disturbing them, with so many people, and so little space. Also, wish there was better/more bird id material."
"I don't like kirwin being used as a large pay for use cow pasture in competition with local property owners. I see less wildlife now than the last 50 years i have visited the refuge."
"I don't like the waty bluff lake looks. Hate the vegetation & weeds to be a pretty lake."
"I don't recall if there are restrooms available along the public trail/bikeway, but if there aren't , there should be (it would be a nice improvement, at least)."
"I encountered one refuge employee in the fall of 2017 who was very disrespectful and rude. Refuge employees should understand their responsibility to be polite to and respectful of visitors to the refuge and to safeguard visitor usage of the refuge, as these visitors own the refuge and have every conceivable right to use it lawfully."
"I enjoy all this at this refuge. Hopefully, our younger children see how important it is to have this land preserved for the wildlife"
"I enjoy how quiet the area tends to be. If i have my dog and family, or if i'm running by myself, i really enjoy how peaceful the park is."
"I enjoy so much an ""escape"" to this refuge as is, though a porta potty is only available, a permanent restroom and shower rinse facilities would be convenient. Overnight designated camping also would be a great refuge experience with rules and regualtionin place and a reasonable fee for maitanance cost."
"I enjoy the small huts/ viewing platforms (especially if it is raining) that have been built in the past few years."
"I feel i cannot truly enjoy or explore the non_beach portion of this refuge because my service dog is not allowed (according to a very hostile employee) therefore, i am limited to certain activities and the beach area where he is permitted."
"I feel very fortunate to live near this wildlife refuge. I enjoy visiting each season, whether fishing, observing wildlife and the serenity just the way it is. I do not want to be intruded by modernization. I like it just like it is. Just reopen some of our former entrances. I do not feel that anyone abuses this wonderful opportunity."
"I find the closure of part of the trail for several months of the year to be annoying and it does not appear to be serving the stated purpose. The trail needs to be longer and not closed during prime walking times."
"I frequently pause at this refuge while driving into new orleans. It's located off highway 90, which is the alternate, stress free, route into the city from my home in the city. I've always enjoyed spending a few minutes here when i have business in thecity. It's a gem of a wildlife refuge that i enjoy immensely."
"I grew up as a small child using the refuge in the late 1960's. Living in the richland area i grew up virtually on the refuge, we fished in rivers & streams bordering the refuge. I learned how to hunt waterfowl safely and correctly even more importantly to appreciate and treasured all wild things."
"I grew up in the area, cache river has only been used to waterfowl hunting. Fishing has been done on white river."
"I have 2 young childrend and they had the most fun catching frogs with nets at the pond. I enjoy the trails, but there were too many mosquitoes when i visited."
"I have a sister with a condition that causes sound to be terribly painful, so she spends most of her time at home. The sherburne county wildlife refuge is only 10 miles or so from her house, and has been such a blessing to us! She doesn't have a lot of energy, and is always dealing with pain, so the wilderness drive, with all of it's opportunities to see and photograph animals, has been a source of great joy to us over the years. We thank you for all you provide!!"
"I have been going to hagerman for 30 years. It continues to improve. The new visitors center was a great addition to the park. When i invite friends up from the dallas area, they are surprised about the size, condition, and facilities, of the park. Most first timers, will comment that they had no idea about the park, and plan a return visit."
"I have been in love with this place since i first stumbled upon it a few years ago. The information at the loop kiosk is great. But i would love to be able to go to a visitor's center, or talk with an employee who knows more about the wildlife, habitat, trail access, camping, and really understand how to access all areas of the park. It's hard to figure out where to go from the website, or from a map, especially to see more of the dune area. I went to the horse campground to photograph the map, and had tofigure out on my own how to try to get closer to the dunes. I accessed through the campground, but never did find a way to see this area from a trail. At the campground, i saw a sign about the uncas dunes and really wanted to view this. It indicated a trail to the right of the sign, but i could not find a trail.   The wildlife loop is well marked at the beginning, lots of good info. But a brochure indicated that the oak savanna visitor center was by appt only, so i did not attempt to go. If there is another visitor center, it was not clear from my 2 visits in the last few years. I did enjoy 2 trails off of the wildlife loop - one short in the prairie, and one short one in the oaks. I would love to camp here also, but i had to go to the campsites in person to see if i would want to (and i would), there is very little info that i could find on the website about it. I may also be unclear if the campground and dunes are part of the refuge? But if not, some cross promo would be helpful since i wanted to doboth in one day, driving from st. Paul.  I love the refuge, the peacefulness (not a lot of busses and traffic). I think biking and canoeing would be amazing here. I loved that one of the brochures allowed foraging within 100 feet of trails. I think thiscould be a big draw for people, and love that it is allowed and also protects wildlife with the 100 foot rule, and i was there in morel season, so i did look for mushrooms a bit (but did not find any).  It would"
"I have been to the visitor center at other times and it is awesome. This trip occurred during the recent government shutdown."
"I have multiple sclerosis and unable to walk trails so, the drive thru auto wildlife trail is my happy place. It's the most beautiful place to getaway & be with nature & love the wildlife."
"I have never had a bad experience at the dNWR. The staff and volunteers that i have met over the years have been helpful and friendly. The facilities support my birding and wildlife-watching well."
"I have no additional comments"
"I have real freedom to come and go as i please. When i happen onto someone they're very happy positive about the refuge. Hear its extremely rugged with a lake with old road bed running through it very fun have to pace myself."
"I have to say the staff and volunteers that i interact with here are always the greatest. I usually stop on my way to somewhere so this is a critical rest stop so having a nice time here is refreshing."
"I have visited refuge headquarters previously & its a nice facility for the public. Due to layout of wpa properties in rwb district, probably not used as much as other hq's @ refuges. I enjoy stopping @ other refuge hq's."
"I hike a lot all over san diego counts, and this refuge is the place i hike the most. I like it a lot bit the parking lot needs to be greatly improved, something should be done to improve bikes and hikers sharing narrow trails. Also there are lots of snakes here (the only place i have ever seen them), and improved warning signs should be considered. I'm very happy with the availability of dog waste bags at the parking lot. I'd be happy if the trail system in the refuge were expanded."
"I like chincoteague & blackwater better"
"I like that blackwater has water trails. Would be great if there wer more hiking/walking opportunities"
"I like that no dogs are allowed there.  Trails are well maintained and good for walking and observing. Last year someone labelled all the flowers and many people stopped to learn about the flowers.  I would enjoy more signs about the trees and flowers.   More benches would also be great.  I love this place!"
"I like the set up. I would not update to much on this island. The primitive state of the facilities is just what the doctor ordered."
"I like the way it is run , volunteers could use some more familiarity with ongoing activities of animals/birds."
"I like to encourage to have restrooms at this refuge. I believe is an awesome place but needs restrooms."
"I live down the road from ottawa national refuge. I drive through every weekend to look at the wildlife. I really like when the 7 mile drive through trail is open. I wish it could be opened every weekend. It is a very nice drive to see the wildlife of northern ohio. Thank you!!!!"
"I live in wisconsin and was visiting family in portland for a week. My son and i visited tualatin for the day. We were both very impressed with the facility and all it had to offer. I was also impressed with how the refuge was created and that it is close to a large metropolitan area."
"I live locally (within 20-25 miles) and visited the nisqually refuge with a visitor from out-of-state. (Thus, my answers for spending no money on this visit.) We were both very favorably impressed with the refuge and its visitor center. I expect to return with other visitors in the future."
"I live locally and went to walk the trails. I will definitely come back and tour the refuge. The interns we met were very nice."
"I live me refuge. Sometimes i've seen people walking dogs - more signs/enforcement needed"
"I live near the refuge and visit frequently. I have walked every levee in the place and i have seen some of the most awesome wildlife scenes."
"I live nearby. I'd like to buy an annual entry pass, but i can't do that at the refuge. I need to drive to an office 30 minutes away to do that. It would be nice if i could just put the annual fee into the daily fee box, and be done with it."
"I live very close to this facility and enjoy this area for this reason. It was a deciding factor along with the state park to move here"
"I love hagiman. Have been coming here for as long as i can remember."
"I love hunting but not in a wildlife refuge. My wife & i go to hagerman to see geese & deer and take short hikes. Please do not change direction in the way question are asked."
"I love nisqually refuge. I think fws is doing an excellent job managing it. I hope there will continue to be additional habitat restoration and expansion of the refuge."
"I love sachuest point!! Besides the amazing views, it's peaceful with well-maintained trails, helpful volunteers that we bump into sometimes along the paths. There is always a helpful volunteer in the visitor's center to answer questions about recent events/sightings and they keep the facilities clean and orderly. I feel like it's a hidden gem in ri and like that the trails don't get too crowded."
"I love sachuest wildlife sanctuary and am so grateful that it's nearby for me to visit."
"I love spending time at hagerman NWR. It has become my home away from home over the last nine years. I sorely missed visits there during the months following the floods of 2015. The staff and volunteers are so supportive that i even managed to lead a tour of wildflowers on the refuge and it went very well."
"I love that this refuge is made available for cross country skiing in the winter. I would really like it if the other parts of the refuge were made more available for hiking (and wildlife viewing) at other times of the year. (Canaan valley, wv)"
"I love the cover of the survey."
"I love the facilities as a whole! The visitor center is such a joy to our family. We enjoy the educational areas on display inside, and my son goes through the activities everytime as if it was his first!"
"I love the heinz and enjoy visiting several times a year for birds and wildlife. This visit was especially good as there has been a lot of rain and the marshes look really good. Our previous visit was in fall when the water levels were very low and notmuch was happening."
"I love the refuge!! Its close to my house and there is always lots of wildlife to see, mostly birds but always a large variety!"
"I love the refuge. It has taken a beating from flooding over the last few years. Heavy rains this year wiped out almost all of the winter wheat crop that migrating geese rely upon. The roads and bridges were also damaged, but i can see that the refuge isworking hard to fix the damage. It's about a 2.5 hour round-trip for me from dallas, but i make the trip at least monthly, on average, because of the excellent opportunities for bird and wildlife photography."
"I love the tualatin refuge"
"I love this place. Something different to see each time."
"I love this refuge and appreciate the work of the staff and volunteers. I don't know if it would be possible, but additional trails would be nice."
"I love this refuge and feel that we are very lucky to have it in our area. It is very nice and a wonderful place to see many different species of birds. I do not agree with the hunting policies. I believe that a wildlife refuge should be a refuge. Itshould be a safe place for wildlife. They close the trails and allow hunting on this refuge and i fear that they will one day allow duck hunting. This refuge is a major migration stop for birds, a very important resting place."
"I love this refuge! It is well maintained. I enjoy being able to get away from the city and be in a quiet, well maintained green space. I have been able to observe many different kinds of animals while biking and walking on the trails. The trees and general environment are amazing. I am truly grateful that we have this wildlife refuge available to us. I genuinely hope that it is maintained. I am concerned about the amount of trash that seems to be in the waterways. This seems to come in from thewaterways, not necessarily from people using the wildlife park. This refuge is a wonderful gem in our community and is a refuge for the community as well as wildlife!"
"I love this refuge. It is one of my happy places. I think it is well-run and provides enough opportunities as it is. I would love to be able to walk to different areas but also understand that the increase in people moving through areas would disturb wildlife. It would be awesome if we could have ""quiet trails"" where people are only allowed to whisper or walk quietly.  The existing areas for people get pretty noisy."
"I love this smallconcord impundment great meadows nat. Wildlife refuge! Love the year round bathroom and how accessible the trails are for all people, including elderly etc. I go there as often as possible - 3-5 times a week."
"I love walking there; it is peaceful and quiet."
"I mainly come here to run. The rest of it is nice, but doesn't really apply to me."
"I mostly just come to this refuge to walk and look at wildlife ie mostly birds. I don't avail myself of any other opportunities that maybe offered."
"I never saw any facilities at the refuge. Just the trailhead."
"I never seem to be able to catch anybody at the refuge headquarters (during the work week, during business hours). For the past two days i have been unable to reach anybody by telephone there either (work week, during business hours also). This has alwaysseemed to be a difficult task for as long as i have been visiting the refuge."
"I once again did not rate this refuge for opportunities i did not use."
"I only hiked the trail."
"I only stopped by during a trip to new orleans because i wanted to see a bayou, and this was the closest to the north ward."
"I only use this place to run."
"I only visit the concord part of the refuge which is not staffed."
"I only visited a very small section of the refuge. Looking for a rare bird. I did not explore the whole refuge"
"I only went on one hike and i did not know i was in any particular refuge"
"I really enjoy the visitor sightings log board"
"I really enjoyed my first visit to the nisquallynational wildlife refuge. There were so many eagles (6) and an owl who kept gliding all over us and a kestral. So memorable a trip. Great info center employees or volunteers."
"I sincerely hope that plans for more vehicular access to this refuge is given more consideration. Automobiles create too much dust and noise for an enjoyable walk/hike. If the animals could speak for themselves, i think they would agree. This refuge isideal for folks to get outdoors to socialize & exercise; we deserve a clean environment to fully enjoy the experience.."
"I sometimes like to walk alone but don't like to come here because it's so secluded and i don't feel safe. It would be great if there was someone patrolling the main trail."
"I squirrel hunt with dogs. The refuge closes squirrel season in november when it is the best time to hunt with a squirrel dog. The refuge needs to make the season longer."
"I stumbled on the refuge because i was visiting the harriet tubman museum. I found it on trip advisor and am glad i did. Beautiful drive. Peaceful and so many birds. Wonderful decks. Great place."
"I suggest adding some picnic tables near parking lots."
"I suppose it would be nice to have friday open. But understand there may be need to close for one day per week."
"I think it's a shame that you cannot camp there. It's crazy that they burn the refuge at the time of the year since birds (upland) are nesting at that time."
"I think speed limit signs and trash cans should be placed along the roads."
"I think the refuge has great awareness programs about the refuge itself. The employees and volunteers are very personable and knowledgeable of the refuge. We visit here routinely for both photography and the peacefulness of the outdoors. There is alwaysbirds and mammals to see if you take your time."
"I think the wildlife center is not located in a good location for a lot of people to experience it. It is an excellent facility for educating children and is a beautiful building with great restrooms. Maybe more signs could explain its importance to thepublic."
"I think they are ruining the benches/sitting areas by locking down the benches and also putting too many benches in"
"I thought everything was just fine."
"I thought it was strange that the volunteers were chastising the visitors about using driftwood as walking sticks. It was the only negative part of our experience. Also we have a national parks pass but weren't informed that we needed to present it at thebeginning of the trail. They need someone or a sign as you enter that there is a charge to hike there."
"I thought the visitor center was beautiful. The restrooms were so clean. The gift shop had appropriate items. I love the photos and the games ie the great lakes challenge"
"I try to visit every year... still learning best times & exploring nearby activities."
"I visit the refuge at least once a week because it has all of the services and facilities i need. I mostly visit for the fresh air and scenery but hike with family on the weekends."
"I visited during the government shutdown but i felt it was handled well. As a birdwatcher i would love there to be more limits surrounding the area on duck hunting"
"I was extremely happy when the old golf course was taken over by shiawassee NWR, fantastic pre-made trails (golf cart trails) and all kinds of wildlife. The area around this refuge is not the best, but i have never felt threatened as it is tucked away andoff the beaten path. I walk there daily weather permitting as therapy. Love this area, let me know if you need help with anything! You can contact me at mlgilson@yahoo.com ."
"I was only here for a brief visit and may never be back in the area again"
"I was suprised how interesting & nice the exhibits were and the movie."
"I was very happy with my experience. I was able to see wild elk, buffalo, pairrie dogs and all kinds of birds/water fowl. Overall, very nice park."
"I was very pleased with the employees, they were knowledgeable and helpful and courteous. I was very happy that the fee was not too expensive. I thought everything was well maintained. Good job!"
"I wish i had spent more time exploring big branch marsh. Next time i'm in the area i will visit independently & not w/a tour"
"I wish parts of the compoundment were available to canoers & kayakers some of the best spots to fish it are off limits to fishing."
"I wish the folks asking for us to participate in this survey knew more about the refuge. They wwer soliciting names/addressess. They did not know too much about the site."
"I wish the refuge was open past sunset."
"I wish the visitor center wer open all days of the week."
"I wish there was a shuttle service to sail water boardwalk. It is too far for mom to walk."
"I wish there was more walking trails or visible signs. When we went the visitor center was closed"
"I wish there were more hiking/walking trails. I'd love to have a 5-6 mile trail available"
"I wish there were more observation platforms to use."
"I wish there were more pull outs along the refuge roads so that i could spend more time photographing birds without blocking traffic."
"I wish there were more trails to access, but also understand that space is limited and must be prioritized to accommodate the wildlife."
"I wish there were more walking trails."
"I wish they would fix the all-weather spotting scopes out on the refuge"
"I wold like to see more events run by the refuge. There are never any people there when we go."
"I would be happy to be an annual member pass or a small entrance fee like state and national parks offer."
"I would be happy to volunteer if opportunities were advertised. Signs could be made clearer & more obvious concerning dogs & bikes not being allowed around the impoundments."
"I would be more satisfied if this refuge offered hunting opportunities, or at least access through it to the adjacent hunting areas."
"I would happily volunteer to help improve this location. Slightly widen paths, clear debris from trails, host events. What is the intention of the refuge team for this site? If it's creating access there is a lot of opportunity for improvement."
"I would like dogs on a leash to be allowed as well as bikes during set hours"
"I would like more trails closer to the wetland ponds in the open field areas"
"I would like the driving trail to be available more days of the year"
"I would like to get closer to birds by another blind or two."
"I would like to have some limited camping opportunities on the island. tent only and by hiking or kayaking to a designated campsite."
"I would like to see a decrease in deer hunts. I would like to see more water on this refuge, during early winter months, for the waterfowl and eagles"
"I would like to see bathrooms availibility."
"I would like to see better maintained bicycle trails. The dirt access roads are not well serviced for cycling."
"I would like to see more trails open during nesting if it could be arranged and not obstruct the birds."
"I would like to see the area behind the visitor center maintained better. This area behind the visitor center is a prime hummingbird viewing area and is usually the neatest part of our trip. I would like to see a water feature there. It looks like there may have been one (pond) before. This area is beautiful and full of potential and is the best place to see hummingbirds that i have ever seen. We see different humming birds every time we go there and enjoy them very much. Also would like to see the hikingtrails maintained a bit better as some of them are overgrown."
"I would like to see the auto route open earlier in the spring. I realize, however, that there are good reasons for not doing so. Thanks for asking for my input. The refuge is a great resource - not very well known to locals."
"I would like to see the gift shop expanded. I love the refuge and would like to give gifts from the shop. It would be nice to buy items online. Note cards, bumber stickers, etc."
"I would like to see the refuge expand its publicly available acreage. I understand that it is necessary to close trails during the fall and winter months due to the migrating and mating activities of the birds, but i miss having the opportunity to accessthose areas when they are closed. I am also against allowing jogging and bicycling in this refuge. It is disturbing to nature and to people who want to walk and enjoy the scenery at their own pace."
"I would like to see this refuge open to more hunting opportunities."
"I would like to walk my dog in the cypress forest boardwalk area. There is a shortage of dog parks and this is a perfect place to unleash my dog for a closed area walk in safety and with very limited persons there. I go early in the morning to walk my dogthere on occasion even though i know dogs are not welcomed. Please welcome them!"
"I would like to walk my dog when i take my walks!!"
"I would love more educational signage. Also, more signs for guidance on trails. I can't remember if restrooms were available or not because i didn't use them."
"I would love to hear more about ways to volunteer at the refuge as well as wildlife learning experiences."
"I would not like to see any commercialization at this park. The beauty of it is because it is so pristine. Any type of commercialization -- shuttle, tours, bike rentals, etc. -- would take away from the silence in bird watching, walking, taking photos, etc. This is one of the only places on the island that is accessible and quiet. We need more quiet places in our busy lives."
"I would not visit any refuge that allowed bicycles & cars."
"I would really like to see kayak/canoe opportunities here."
"I would suggest opening up a small game hunting season for a short period in feb. after duck season closes."
"I would suggest that a port-a-potty be placed in the area of the wetlands overlook. It's a long ways from the visitors center and consequently there are many remnants of tp/kleenex alongside the trails - not healthy for wildlife or humans"
"I,m a local and visit here often for peace ,& tranquility and keeping in touch with the natural world"
"If possible it's great to be able to park in a shady spot"
"If the visitor center isn't open, the only restroom option is an outhouse that isn't clean and has no sink or sanitizer. Visitors could use a couple trash cans too, one is hard to find"
"If there were facilities at the kilauea point national wildlife refuge, we did not see them."
"If this is a refuge i don't understand why killing animals is allowed  ??"
"If weather/snow permits, i wish the wildlife drive could be open a greater part of the year"
"Improve reflector location for blind locating. Map orovided to find blind inadequate.a long distance google earth photo doesn't show blind location.a hand drawn sketch as used at magee marsh (next door) is more informative. Young lady providing blind location was not imformative."
"Improved restrooms please"
"In general i think everything is nice here"
"In regards to the auto tour, it seems that the diverse use of the trail has led to it being used by runners, bicyclists, walkers, and in one case a uni cyclist. The rules for the auto tour need to be more available to users."
"Invasion of cat tails and chinese water lilies have ruined this refuge."
"It'd be nice if there were a visitor center that had information about the trail. A vending machine for water or a filtered water fountain available would be nice. A bathroom would be nice as well."
"It's a great place to bring your young children. Volunteers are friendly & helpful. A lot to see and experience both insided the facility and outside on trails and beaches. My son and i loved coming here during our time in ri."
"It's all on my previous comment."
"It's been several years since we visited this this refuge. We were pleasantly surprised at the improvements. It used to be pretty bare-bones and is now comparable to other facilities."
"It's hard to accurately answer the questions, as asked because the refuge facilities are naturally a little ""primitive"" to fit the reason we come to enjoy the birds (primarily) and other wildlife in natural states. More modern facilities and a fancy visitor center on site might take away that enjoyment for us. And bicyclists might scare off the birds that automobiles don't. One idea, in lieu of private autos, might be to rent compact electric vehicles (like enclosed golf carts). Passengers remain inside,the air is less polluted and it could be a revenue stream (if managed properly). But tour buses would be incompatible with the ""schedule"" of a great blue heron's movements."
"It's too bad whomever mowed the brush next to the elevated boardwalks, mowed too wide and cut down many of the newly planted trees, evidence by all the torn up nutria guards laying on the ground."
"It is a great place to visit and important to the community and hopefully will continue to be and won't be under funded or cut back in any way. Public lands should be protected and funded by all of us. Never let private companies have the land. Never letpoliticians take it away."
"It is a refuge and should stay that way."
"It is disappointing that all the years we have come here (shiawassee) the visitor center has never been open. Also most importantly the only bathrooms are a long walking distance up a hill near the entrance making it very difficult for people with disabilities. We also wish it (shiawassee) was open first of may and go into october, not june and september"
"It is perfectly fine that the refuge closes to protect birds during nesting season. We are extremely satisfied with the refuge hours even though there is closure for a good chunk of the year. The kiosk is fine too -- don't think you need a whole visitor center."
"It is ridiculous that an agreement can not be made to allow refuge staff to use cash registers and help serve the public. They do it all over the western states and alaska."
"It is unfortunate that the visitor centre is not open, and funds are not available for the safety/ upgrading of the present structure so that it can be used for the programs which used to be held there."
"It is well-maintained and allows for a very peaceful retreat from civilization."
"It is well run and well appreciated.,i have used it for over 40 years, and my 12 year old loves it too (wildlife.)"
"It seems to me that the visitor's center is often closed on weekends when peak visitors would be present at times of the waterfowl migrations. I have been fortunate to have seen the visitor's center and its exhibits and spoken to the staff and volunteers,but being open often only on weekdays during peak migrations seems to make little sense to me for the benefit of other visitors who my be making their first visit."
"It was a nice experience"
"It was a nice place to fish. even though it was not designed for it."
"It was great! Workers were friendly and helpful"
"It was small. No visitor center or wokers available."
"It would be cool to see more animals, but the birds were really cool to see more to see/explore. The main improvement i would make is more paved paths for wheelchairs."
"It would be good to be able to access more of the refuge. Right now you can only stay on the periphery."
"It would be great if there were more hiking/walking trails as well as bike trails which were accessible from town or from the visitor's center so that you don't have to drive everywhere. I would love to be able to park the car and then walk orbike to slowly explore things but on paths that are not alongside or near the roads, so to avoid car pollution, noise, etc."
"It would be great if they would open up more trails for bird watching. Many trails are there, but closed to the public. It would also be nice to get a better (and warmer) hand dryer in the bathroom, such as an xlerator. In the winter, the sink water isicy cold, and the current hand dryer is pitiful and does not dry. It's hard to go back out into the elements with frozen, wet hands (especially when handling a camera)."
"It would be great to have flush toilets at this location."
"It would be nice if green point was open on the weekend."
"It would be nice if more things on the path were labeled. I would like to know what plants i am looking at"
"It would be nice if the visitor center was open on sunday."
"It would be nice if the visitor center were open earlier in the day--7 or 8 am instead of 9 am.--mainly for access to restroom facilities. Visitors interested in viewing wildlife often arrive in the early morning and would appreciate being able to stop atthe visitor center upon arrival."
"It would be nice if the wildlife drive were open yer round"
"It would be nice if there was something to hold on to at the dock to help get in and out of boats."
"It would be nice if there were various hours of gate closing times that varied & were posted according to month. Just saying ""sunset"" can mean different things to different people & you can get locked in."
"It would be nice if wildlife observers got more access to wildlife during the winter rather than hunters. Always hearing the gunshots is obnoxious and ridiculous to be allowed in a refuge."
"It would be nice to be able to camp at the lake. Also i think we should be able to fish on down the lake to the refuge."
"It would be nice to be able to drive clockwise sometimes on the auto route instead of always going counter clockwise for photographic variety."
"It would be nice to have a flat pedastal stand (like at many nps) to steady your camera on to take unaided photos in front of monument signs."
"It would be nice to have a restroom  i know this would be expensive to maintain so i understand why there is not one"
"It would be nice to have a restroom available near the parking lot"
"It would be nice to have a restroom but this is wilderness."
"It would be nice to have benches about every quarter mile along the long gravel path beside the canal, with brush cleared so the water if visible"
"It would be nice to have volunteers or employees on hand to enforce one regulations such as no dogs, no bikes on trail, no beach parking"
"It would be perfect if that one area was all dirt path because the long grass on the trail leads to ticks, friends do not want to come back once they find ticks on them"
"It would be really nice if basic wall blinds were in place to allow visitors to watch from and not spook wildlife and more boardwalks through wetlands."
"It would be wonderful to have bike paths, but i fear that would disturb the wildlife."
"It would be wonderful to have more hiking opportunities, but with it being a refuge of course, the wildlife are more important"
"Its a beautiul spot that we are grateful to take advantage of for running. The paths are nice the volunteers great and always glad to use a clean safe restroom"
"Its well maintained and the visitor center is beautiful."
"Jogging not allowed on trails. If jogging was allowed i would us the trails an average of 2-3 times per week. Also, the long trail around the perimeter of the refuge is only open in the summer, if it was open year around i would visit more often in non-summer months."
"Just checking it out for future trips; we looked at a housing development in the area for possible retirement living."
"Just riding through"
"Just would like to see butt-heads ticketed for parking in handicap spots that are not handicapped!"
"Keep it open"
"Keep on planting this refuge."
"Keep up the good work!"
"Kiosks had enough information to get me oriented, but other information to interpret the area and refuge resources would have been nice. I appreciated the trail signage at each junction along the trail network (on middle island)"
"Know for trails with beautiful ocean views, fishing off the rocks, snowy white owls in winter and a variety of birds and water fowl and deer. A beautiful location. The restroom open from the outside is much appreciated."
"Larest concern is lack of any bathroom facility, including no port-o-let"
"Less muddy - haha! Force of nature that we have to deal with. But very pleased that there was netting on this trail for traction. Mud or not - very happy."
"Like to night fish, closes too early. No way to put fishing pole holder into concrete ( i mentioned this to employees last year)"
"Limited access to hike/walk/kayak. This could be improved vastly."
"Loose gravel makes it harder for strollers, biking for kids."
"Love hagerman!"
"Love it!"
"Love maintained trails. Thank you. Clean, easy to walk in & most importantly takes care of animals"
"Love ratidian! Best beach on guam!"
"Love the chalkboard comments of bird/wildlife sitings , asking others about what wildlife they've observed"
"Love the ottawa wildlife refuge visitors center! Always clean and interesting with helpful staff!"
"Love the play area"
"Love the refuge. It's my favorite place to walk & meditate."
"Love this place for birding. Unique in the area. Well used by so many different people for different purposes. Don't let anything happen to it."
"Love this place!"
"Loved the visitors vented and movie."
"Loved this place.  I love to see bird rookeries. Paths are easy to walk"
"Loved visiting and learning about the refuge."
"Lovely restrooms, beautiful refuge-themed tiles showing local animal and plant life (turtles, leaves, insects, birds)."
"Main hqtrs facilities are in extremely poor condition; no real visitors center, nor environmental education opportunities, other than plankhouse with mainly cultural events. Wish joint venture with local water guides or water launch sites for water trails. Wish fishing platforms and equipment rentals. Wish complete overhaul of hqtrs and new visitor center that is commensurate with other national sites."
"Maintain bathrooms on the busy weekend"
"Make america green again"
"Management for upland species is critical and much needed on public lands. Prescribed fire seems to be the most efficient tool to manage upland habitats, but it seems to be underutilized on this refuge. Scratching out and managing even meager amounts ofupland habitats is critical to provide refuge on public lands as it is unlikely to be an undertaking of private landowners in the cache river basin."
"Many of the signs blocking off interesting off-trail areas should be taken down. Perhaps new trails should be added. But the 'refuge' is better without ridiculous regulations, and people who wish to go off-trail will do so irregardless."
"Many of these questions do not apply as this was previously just fairly small open public space with fire roads and bike trails. Only recently did it apparently become a wildlife refuge."
"Many of trails repaired this season much appreciated!"
"May come up later, but we found some of the interpretive signs confusing. There are discs in the refuge listing a bird and insinuating that your supposed to do something and you can listen to their unique songs. There were no instructions and we could notfigure out how to operate. Could use some signage around perimeter with mileage to various points. We weren't sure if we were getting off the track and could get back to our car from one area."
"Maybe signs for limited or no access to say like a road be more colorful or larger so better to be seen."
"Men's restroom toilet clogged and low flush pressure"
"Men's restroom was closed, had to use the sani-kan. Ladies restroom was not the cleanest and not up to date"
"Might be nice to have out houses at some of your parking lots at funk, ne"
"Money spent does not really apply to me since i live down the road. When we did travel to come to the biggest week, we used hotels, restaurants, gas, etc and spent around $1500 a trip"
"More accessible trails"
"More and better trail signs would've been useful."
"More blinds, more trails"
"More educational opportunities, please."
"More enforcement for rules like people bringing digs in the park and feeding the alligators."
"More hiking trails, areas to get out and walk around"
"More hiking/biking trails beyond the visitor's center"
"More interactive exhibits. Pleased with our interaction with the staff or volunteer at the visitor center. More opportunities for urban residents to have access to the refuge and/or extend the refuge into the urban area through stream corridors."
"More lighting at boat launch"
"More marked hiking trails are needed, and large easy to read maps of trails with mileage."
"More restrooms"
"More trails"
"More visible volunteers outdoors would be useful."
"More wilderness experience opportunities on the weekends, rather than just during the week. Would appeal to folks who work rather than just retirees."
"Most refuges we have visited (mn sd ne nd mt) have no staff available nor visitor centers open on weekends. Saturday and sunday are days when time is most available for a visit, yet the refuge operation seems to shut down on those days. Makes no sense tome."
"Most trails are relatively short. I appreciate all the features at the refuge (overlooks, board walks, newer trails). would like more cycling opportunities and longer trails."
"Mostly just been to boat launch so don't know about what else refuge has to offer!"
"Mostly walking bike trail"
"Multiple water trails and ponds provide excellent opportunities to enjoy short or longer canoe/kayak excursions and to enjoy the quiet wilderness. Also, several hiking trails through woods, fields or along waterways are excellent for walking, bird-watching and a chance to see other wildlife."
"My family and i love this place very educational for young children and increased awareness for older children and teens"
"My husband & i are semi disabled and do not own a boat. We need more shore access & dock fishing access and in some cases an easier way to get to those amenities."
"My only comment is to keep the grass trim on the walking trail, as there is a tick problem. Also, it would be good to keep the deer population down. Also, there are too many canadian geese-- they can be very menacing & aggressive especially in the springtime."
"My overall experience was quite positive and i will be returning in the spring with more family members. Was glad to see a local school using the facility for a field trip."
"My responses are solely for bayou lacombe. There is not a restroom, welcome center, hiking trails, volunteers or employees. I would love to see at least a restroom and more fishing piers."
"My second trip this time (july 2018) was on a tuesday or wednesday. I was sad the visitor center was closed. Earlier in july i went on the weekend and enjoyed the visitor center."
"My son had a great time at the youth waterfowl camp. It was very educational but still fun for the kids."
"My visit was during the us government shut down thus no facilities were open and the employees were furloughed"
"My visitors center"
"My wife and i drive around this refuge almost weekly when we are home. We love it. We only wish we could get in earlier in the year and later in the fall. We love the place."
"My wife and i go to this refuge every few weeks to stretch our legs on the boardwalk, look at birds and animals from the decks, and walk the loop around the impoundments. It never fails to be a great, short visit and i'm always impressed by how well maintained the trails and facilities are. We've never seen a guide there, but this isn't a problem - we go there for a foray into nature, and it's great."
"My wife is in mid-stage dementia. Early on, a bit over two years ago, i realized that an almost daily trip to the ridgefield refuge is very satisfying to her. It is an activity that has allowed me to develop recognition of over a hundred bird species andto enjoy some great video and photography opportunities. On our very first visit, a hawk landed on a branch next to us, and i was able to take video of it in the process of devouring a large snake it had in its mouth. My wife, meanwhile, is always thrilled to see a great blue heron, a rabbit or a fawn, so we have something we can do together that never gets old for either of us."

"Needs shoulder on the roads to pull over, everything else was good. Parking lot was flooded but not much you can do about that. Could possibly pave other lot that was mud and hard to use"
"Nice drive, would like to see more trails opened at least for walking or biking"
"Nice facility"
"Nice trails. well maintained."
"Nicely maintained, employees and volunteers very nice"
"Nisqually has very impressive facilities -- clean, well-constructed, attractive visitor center; nice, clean bathrooms; really nice displays and signage describing the refuge and aspects of it; strong/good signage outside; really nicely maintained walkingtrail, especially the impressive boardwalk that keeps you from disturbing wildlife and keeps you dry; peaceful and nice picnicking area by the old barn. A++ on all facilities - very impressive."

"North dakotans are really nice people"
"Not a big fan of blah desert, so not likely to return for recreation since it means 40mi+ drive on dirt/off-road past the visitor center to a site with water/trees/camping and maybe some wildlife like the beloved bighorn sheep. Glad wildlife has a home.glad there is some boundary to the sprawl which is still expanding here in vegas....Much more interesting rec opportunities no farther from vegas than this."
"Not all dog owners leash their pets. No fun to have them chasing you when your running!"
"Not many picnic areas"
"Not really sure where services are actually listed within the refuge"
"Not sure if its okay to use some trails. Signs confuse me, they are poorly marked"
"Not sure if or what opportunites are available, no way of knowing"
"Observed family operating a drone on the boardwalk in the wetland area.  Signs prohibiting this should be posted."
"Of the 2 restrooms only one locks"
"Offer the draw hog hunts before conducting the helicopter eradication. Conducting planting for doves would be beneficial."
"Ok you have opened up part of the area to small game hunting and preditor hunting. Such as fox, coyotes, and raccoons. But you want us trappers that are trying to help you control the populations to pay you to do this. I don't think this is fairon those areas. I understand that you need numbers to see what is taken each year.  And some people won't tell you that. But i trap most of the farms in that area.  I have seen a huge increase of stolen traps now so so areas i won't set.but i don't think it is fair that you can hit those animals and have to pay to trap them is all i am saying."
"Okefenokee is a wonderful place to watch the seasons changing. Different wild flowers throughout the year are seen along the road, as well as snakes, alligators and birds."
"On one of our walks a refuge employee or volunteer was sharing w/guide that passed by what is in the water pointing out some of the wildlife we wouldn't see otherwise it was great!"
"Once again you cannot get to a great urban fishery because refuge people won't take time or effort to check out why they are no trucks & boat trailersw in beautiful parking lot & nice launch. The canal going there is blocked."
"One employee at the boat rental facility was very rude. Okefenokee nat park"
"One of the viewing towers had a broken step. Enjoyed seeing otters."
"One of the walking bridges was out during the summer, understand it has been repaired...but now is closed for the season. A sign at the registration kiosk indicating what is open and what is closed would be helpful."
"Only 2 bathrooms, long lines. Visior center was closed"
"Only restroom i know of is at visitor center & martha's theatre education resources and programs are too limited. Why did they chap trees on trail by visitor center and why no posted information on this. They n"
"Only the beach should be opened up for walking, the nesting season neems permanent"
"Open wildlife loo(p year round please."
"Opening the auto route earlier in the spring."
"Opportunities to attend the park as dawn arrives or as dusk finishes would give extra chances to see wildlife, beyond daylight only hours."
"Other than stopping to get on platform and look out at the river or swampy area, we usually drive thru. We drive thru during all the time the refuge is open love it"
"Other than the constant gun fire or canon fire from the adjacent farms, lox is a very peaceful refuge in overdeveloped south florida. Hopefully it will always stay a refuge and more will be done to conserve and keep this beautiful area natural and a place for wildlife for the future."
"Other than the folks taking surveys i've never seen a refuge employee."
"Other than two interns that were very kind and informative.. No one one else was around maintaining the park or opening up restrooms, etc. Very sad."
"Ottawa is very well run and has nice facilities and friendly staff & volunteers. I wish i lived closer."
"Ottawa NWR is one of the best-kept wildlife refuges that i have visited. They really do a fantastic job keeping the facilites fantastic."
"Our famiy really enjoys the serenity of the nisqually."
"Our visit was during the government shutdown, so visitor center and refuge employees were closed/not present. The visitor center looked nice"
"Our visit was in october, understanding chance of variety of wildlife in refuge. Our pleasure was walking trails, seeing herons, egrets, swans."
"Outhouse at the main boat ramp on spillway road is in poor condition."
"Outstanding visitor center with superb programs for school children with education about wildlife and conservation. Great periodic programs for the interest of the general public too. Large variety offered and outstanding speakers brought in. Very valuable to our community."
"Outstanding!"
"Over the years pinkney goes through changes it would be nice to know what is happening and why. This year the ibis pond had a lot of dead nesting areas there was no explanation as whether it was caused by man or natural causes. In the past man made ""improvements"" have caused birds to abandon to ""improved"" area"
"Overall lakes level flucuation not helpful for this refuge's health"
"Overall the refuge is a nice place to be. there is an ample amount of opportunities for fishing, hunting, etc. the problem i run into a lot is the amount of space given for hunting. as an avid waterfowl hunter i dont like people setting up 80 yards from me because they have no where else to go. there just isnt enough room for more then about 2-3 groups. at this like it seems the west side in particular doesnt get used at all and i feel in order to get more hunters in the area you need to give them more places to hunt rather than just part of a creek arm. that is really the only thing i feel strongly about the refuge that needs changed."
"Overall, i was extremely happy with this refuge, largely because of the opportunity to so immerse myself in nature."
"Overall, the refuge is a very nice place, and i love the boardwalk for my wife. However, for me, bicycling is not allowed on refuge trails, and i am a very respectful biker, and always defer to walkers. But, i do realize that not all bikers are so polite.no vehicles are allowed along the road/path to the canoe launch area, and it is a far distance for a single person to carry a canoe or kayak. I am retired and it is too far for me to carry my kayak - about 100 yards or more."
"Pads and parking lots are not maintained"
"Park gate should be open daylight - sundown 7 days/week. Use of any size boat motor set to ""idle only"""
"Partnership with the vancouver audubon society volunteers is important -- their event is what drew us to the refuge. However, their website for birdfest & bluegrass was not very good."
"People and facilities top rate"
"People need to stop smoking ciggarettes on the trail. There's butts everywhere and children who should not be exposed. This should be enforced."
"People who live locally will have very different answers to many of these questions than people on vacation"
"Personal and professional staff/volunteers great wildlife photo notebook!!"
"Place is one of the gems of the area."
"Please clean off all the goose dropping from the walkways & parking lot going into the welcome center. This is always a problem when we visit."
"Please clean the bathrooms. Icky! Would love to have more places where we could photograph from, esp closer, such as blinds. Please do not advertise for cyclists in the summer when you can walk the auto loop. Trying to navigate cyclists (and i am one) while everyone is looking up and not on the road is a recipe for problems."
"Please do something about the gnatts in the area of the refuge and the carp in the white river"
"Please don't enable bike riding, jogging, and other activities which conflict with what is now a peaceful, family oriented place."
"Please indicate more clearly what wildlife other than birds are available for observance every month of the year. Advertising what birds/wildlife can be seen would be very attractive to visitors."
"Please keep in mind t hat this evaluation is only based on a 60 minute visit."
"Please keep this refuge exactly as it is now. It is in a mostly undeveloped & natural state; which is exactly as it should be. Bathrooms at the entrance & halfway around the auto tour route are more than sufficient, no other buildings are need or desired.the kios & informational boards at entrance give good info (what birds have been recently spotted, etc.)"
"Please make signs more clear"
"Please never allow hunting"
"Please note that, given the nature of the kilauea lighthouse visitors area, many of the items rated here in this survey are not nearly as relevant, in my opinion, as they would be in a place that i would more closely associate with a ""wilderness"" type ofwildlife refuge location. I remain unaware of any fishing, hunting, kayaking, etc. opportunities at the lighthouse location. It would not surprise me to learn that the specific nature of this place makes those considerations irrelevant to most, and maybeall visitors."
"Please, do not put trams or guided tours in this NWR! The visitors who drive the loop at 25mph+, never get out of their cars, and wonder why they don't see anything is bad enough already. The last thing blackwater needs is crowds and noise!!!"
"Pleased to find refuge open daily. In past have visited there when, during our entire stay, the refuge was closed. Boo."
"Plenty of canoes outside of the visitor center, but our rental time is restricted by some small minutes by one of the staff members. Strange."
"Poor management, nothing gets fixed, where is the wildlife? The grassland this is a joke more animals outside then in refuge. No deer, the pools are wastelands no wawterfowl"
"Portable toilets would be nice."
"Power wheel chair would be nice"
"Previous trips have visited the visitors center. All is great, but an educational video is a little out dated. Employees were courteous/nice."
"Primarily visit for wildlife viewing - more boardwalks over water are always welcome"
"Primary purpose of visits are walking which i do several times a week during warm months. When i have stopped into center it is always clean & informative."
"Public restrooms are always a challenge - overflows, no toilet paper, water not warm for cold hands, blow dryers don't dry"
"Quite few visitors were fishing so it be a good refuge for that. As for hunting there needs to be isolated areas so not so sure about."
"Rainy day. Didn't get to explore as much as wanted."
"Re-open trails asap after storms or other damage"
"Really appreciate the extended hours which allow the visitor center to be open. Would like to see more wildflower growth - perhaps a volunteer activity. Nice facility inside and out. Enjoy viewing the bison and elk and other small animals."
"Really enjoyed the bird watching hike - good information and good group - found out about it from the advocate suggest more publicity for these events - it was advertised as breakfast with the birds great title"
"Really like the auto tour being open much more than in the past."
"Really need to have some type of rest rooms available. I would visit more often if this were the case."
"Refuge center closed due to trump's shutdown."
"Refuge in great shape this year. Many new walking trails cut. Lots of rain this year was helpful to bring back lots of wildlife and birds."
"Refuge is in great shape for me."
"Refuge is the island. Survey does not apply"
"Refuge is too close to the highway and should be larger"
"Refuge is very well maintained with pleasant staff. Great place to view and photograph wildlife."
"Refuge needs actual restrooms near beach area (which should be maintained) and showers for rinsing after swimming or trail hikes."
"Refuge service buildings minimal except kiosk. No restrooms, vistors centers or rangers stations!"
"Refuge was essentially closed because of hunting season. Very disappointed. However, better to be closed that shot at accidentally."
"Relatively small refuge with walking/observation the seemingly primary purpose"
"Representatives in visitor center were both very helpful and nice. Much appreciated!"
"Rest area management needs to see some changes. The cache river NWR and bald knob NWR rest area have killed local duck hunting. I understand the need to provide food for wintering waterfowl, but when the ducks completely eat out the rest area fields by december (which comes straight from the mouth of one of the local federal waterfowl biologists) what are they supposed to do for the rest of the winter? The feds should wait till late january and february to flood these feed fields so that the birds actually gain something before returning north."
"Restroom's very clean. Would welcome feeding station at bird watching station"
"Restroom doors need attention. Restrooms could use more frequently cleaning during high use periods. Could use a few more benches and the benches could be better placed than they currently are."
"Restroom or portable rest room half way around auto route."
"Restroom was clean"
"Restroom wasn't working at visitor center. We rented boat, motor fell off boat almost went in swamp."
"Restrooms and trails are always well maintained."
"Restrooms are very much appreciated! Beautiful and inviting buildings! I plan to bring a lunch someday for my husband and i to sit in your picinic table area :)"
"Restrooms at the visitor center are great, but the refuge could use some ones that can be accessed when the center is not open (other than the port-a-john by the river parking lot)."
"Restrooms could alwasys be better"
"Restrooms need hand soap and towels or functioning hand dryer."
"Restrooms need improvement. Waited til i found a starbucks"
"Restrooms need improvements. Not enough stalls during busy times/not cleaned frequently. Seat provides poor body mechanics. Please install 'squatty potty' as are common outside of us. Many international visitors frequest this refuge."
"Restrooms need some improvement."
"Restrooms on site!"
"Restrooms were clean and supplied w/paper products"
"Restrooms would be welcomed"
"Ridgefield is unique. Cars can travel at their own speed and watch for birds, take photos etc. I think there should be better reminders to encourage people to remain in their cars along the roads and that there is a port--potty available halfway throughthe tour route.  (Not wanting people to get out and use the side of their cars)"
"Ritidian is one of our favorite spots on guam. We often bring guests hope that access will not be restricted by the military."
"Roads are mostly dirt surface. It had been wet for the previous days and the roads were a little bit sloppy. Some gravel on the roads would help."
"Roads were narrow grass not mowed passing log trucks were scary"
"Sachuest is one of the best facilities; everything is clean and well maintained and the trails are great. We always see many birds and occasionally deer."
"Sad to see so many water plants and no wildlife in water"
"Sadly the refuge is closed more often than not."
"Safety with person available around trails maybe cameras. Many times do not take trail since no one around."
"Satisfactory"
"Satisfied with the availability of all services."
"Satuest point is well mapped out has valuable volunteers"
"Saw an amazing variety of birds, insects, butterflies, moths, and evenan armadillo! Thoroughy enjoyed the hiking trails."
"Seasonal closures to protect wildlife makes sense. Would be nice to have other ways to get in to see things when the main parts are closed. Sorry - that's not very helpful:)"
"See below for signage concerns. Rising at -6am refuge many using do not see, usually, reviews of refuge blocked by signs. This is a problem at several refuges in oregon & washington"
"See previous comments."
"See section 3/question 2"
"Seeing an albino coypu (nutria) was a highlight of the recent trip and the young man who was taking information regarding this survey was very helpful verifying we did indeed see an albino."
"Seeing as i only saw it from the boat, i have nothing to really say about it. Sorry. We were on a bus trip from the cleveland area."
"Seems like it is more of a motor tour type of facility"
"Self guided refuge - no volunteers - facilities are good could use a trash can"
"Services are good for the location and environment of this refuge."
"Services at ridgefield NWR are minimal & poor"
"Services plenty good enough facilities plenty good  opportunities great. I love being able to have a place to hunt an fish an the opportunities are terrific here"
"Several interesting exhibits at the visitor center."
"Several large potholes in gravel road loop. (West side road) hard to bird watch and walk without looking down"
"Several years ago i utilized the refuge almost every day - walking and observing wildlife - however due to health issues i'm unable to walk like i used to. But back then this was my ""happy place""!"
"Should close at the dusk not 4 p.m."
"Should open up old hiking trails that are off limits now. san miguel mnt."
"Signage can be improved for this refuge especially coming from the freeways. Did not know if there is a visitor center. A few restrooms would greatly improve the experience of hiking/walking on the trails. It is such a pleasant environment and has greatly improved with continual landscaping, etc. The signage regarding bird watching is excellent. The seating and photo taking area has recently been improved."
"Signage could be improved (how far away etc.)"
"Signage for no dogs, no bikes, no jogging are routinely ignored or not seen - too small, too off the edge of the trail and should be at the entrance and the parking area for better visibility. - just a thought - just an idea."
"Signage on rules and regulations isn't always very clear or present in areas it should be."
"Signage on the public assess road could be better. We were not clear what facilities are available at this visitors center until we arrived. It is a very nice visitors center with helpful volunteers and nice exhibits."
"Signs along the boardwalk were informative and well maintained - added to the experience"
"Signs for major languages providing information regarding wildlife - ie ""please do not approach or feed wildlife"" in mulitple languages"
"Signs in many cases are too small. A refuge is not a refuge if you promote hunting/fishing"
"Signs in the bathrooms direct people not to throw trash in the toilets, but there are no trash cans anywhere at the refuge"
"Signs to the hiking trails could be a little better. The lower parts of the trails are less marked and a little more difficult to know that you are on the correct path. A few boards may need replacing at the eagles nest observation deck. Otherwise, i was pleased."
"Signs very important of trails"
"Since i live within a short drive (15-20 min) of the refuge, i like to occasionally visit there to walk/hike. It is nice that there are plenty of dirt roads to walk on, but the hiking trail system is limited. It is great to have this refuge in the starkville area as a place to go to experience nature."
"Since so many wildlife drive roads/biking trails were flooded by the previous days windiy rains the excellent visitor center, raised boardwalks, attentive staff checks of flooding receding, and rode watching at magee swamp made the drive well worth it. Great 1st experience!"
"Since we were on the auto tour portion of the refuge, bicycling and kayak/canoe trips were not options and therefore not applicable."
"So fortunate to have this refuge within easy access of the suburban i have recently moved to. I tell everyone how lucky they are to have this reserve nearby."
"So glad the restroom was made available even into the evening."
"Some finds the trail is flooded and one needs to wear rubber boots."
"Some hunting blinds are a long ways from parking lots. Am disabled and have walking issues but don't meet wa state handicapped rules (yet)"
"Some of the kayak trails are blocked or nearly blocked with downed trees or submerged logs"
"Some of these questions are not pertinent as we have just moved to the immeiate area and just begun exploring"
"Some people at the visitor center act like they don't trust you. Top people"
"Somewhat rustic, which is excellent - conservation of golden-cheeked warbler and black-capped vireo habitat is the most important aspect of this refuge."
"Spent several hours here and did not see any wildlife at all. Many of the areas were restricted or off limits to visitors."
"Staff always courteous and helpful. Restrooms indoors always clean. Outdoor restrooms nice for after visitor center hours. Love to have more staff guided wildlife/birding opportunities. Coordination with biggest week events has been great. Nice to be ableto visit and catch a presentation."
"Staff and volunteers were kind and knowledgeable. Better maps of the refuge are needed for me. I would like to know what areas are used my purposes( where is hunting allowed and not allowed or which way to this trail)."
"Staff at visitors center need a broader knowledge of the refuge with specifics about areas off the beaten path and much better more detailed maps. Courteous is great but knowledgeable & helpful is important!"
"Staff does a great job"
"Staff is always great"
"Staff was great. Maintenance staff on boardwalk showed us where a snake was that they had just found and explained about the fire and what it did."
"Staff were very friendly and helpful. Maps should be reviewed for accuracy as noted above."
"Staffing is lacking. More recreational opportunities would be available if adequate staff was provided by dept of interior. Numerous beaches have been closed for example"
"Steigerwald lake is perfect the way it is, please do not change anything about it. Please do not allow hunting and fishing within the refuge as that would cancel out the purpose of a wildlife refuge! Many locals from camas and washougal enjoy walking andwildlife viewing at steigerwald lake and it is an invaluable resource to our community."
"Such welcoming volunteers in the welcome center. Very informative signs. Clean bathrooms"
"Sullys hill was an unexpected, pleasant, surprise on our visit to devils lake for a family wedding. We wished we had seen some elk but did have an opportunity to view some of the buffalo."
"Summer hours for the visitor's center are a bit short. Sun up until 8:30 pm but the center closes at (i think) 4:30 or 5:00 pm"
"Sunset deck is great"
"Super staff, great facility"
"Surprised at the high quality of the visitors center."
"Surprisingly nice restroom."
"Survey way too long"
"Thank you!"
"The ""art"" trail was disappointing, poor art and no information about it."
"The 50 amp electrical service we were provided with our rental either had a bad receptacle or a loose wire in the outlet."
"The 5th grade conservation day for ottawa county middle school students is a fantastic program!"
"The ada trail is often closed and is full of sinkholes."
"The archery deer hunt is an extremely well regulated and supervised program."
"The area is kept extremely clean"
"The auto-tour should be open every day."
"The balcones canyon national wildlife refuge is a gem of the texas hill country! I have attended their songbird festival twice and was so satisfied with the experience the first time (2017) that i extended my st"
"The bathhouses are infested with spiders and other bugs. Grass was uncut. Over ankle height.  Constantly change rules on how to reserve camping spot. Host in b loop is never polite. Host in b loop campsite looks like a dump."
"The bathroom has been missing toilet paper on more than one occasion."
"The bathrooms at steigerwalde are abysmal"
"The bathrooms can be gross at times. Even designation ladies/mens can help with this i think. They are unspecified."
"The bathrooms in the confort stations neet to get redone."
"The bathrooms were overflowing with trash and disgusting. the lookout areas are overrun with vegetation that you can't see past. the boardwalk has holes and loose boards. there were no signs indicating the regulations. the pavillion had a burned area in it."
"The best"
"The big standing binoculars overlooking the rocks are kind of awkward and hard to adjust. I don't think it is the fault of the refuge, just the nature of the beast!"
"The bird blind was great for bird photography. Couldn't get close enough to eagles for good photos."
"The biscoe bottoms at the cache river NWR have a very poor maintained for the past few years due to logging"
"The boat guides were great, taught us a lot, pointed out brids, wildlife, plants. We wanted to see gators up close and did on the drive loop."
"The boat ramps and docks are in very poor condition as well. The roads that lead to the ramps are in very poor condition also. Some of the boat ramps have pot holes and one of the ramps even had a pile of rocks on it under water and was opened up for usethis way. Docks have nails sticking off the sides that scratch boats. Hunting opportunities are poor due to the lack of crops planted on the refuge. We hunted pheasants for 3 days and deer also and both species were few and far between."
"The buckthorn removal is very important to your neighbors and i am one."
"The cat trails grow up and block the waterview. The amount of open water has decreased dramaticly."
"The center should be open earlier. Access to the restrooms should be dawn to dusk."
"The concentrationof hikers has dramatically increased at this one summit hike, since all other summit trail hikes in the same refuge have been closed permanently. This over-use has dramatically led to trail erosion and need for on-going maintenance. Italso takes away from the enjoyment."
"The decking and signage were well maintained here."
"The decrease in wildlife habitat has had a substantial effect on wildlife numbers and opportunity for harvest. Most tree cover has been removed and food plots are no longer planted. My satisfaction with the area has decreased substantially in the last several years, i have used the area for the last 30 years."
"The degradation of items in the environment was a very powerful display. We have stopped using one use plastic plates, glasses and plastic ware because of it."
"The east rest room door at the main boat ramp was warped and i had to have my husband wrench it open for me and i'm not a weakling. He's 6'2"" and 220 lbs. I'd have felt bad for a smaller person to get it open. I'm not handicapped but if i were, i'd be disappointed in the set up at the boat dock. It is possible that the other toilets are better but i couldn't tell for sure from the boat."
"The employees & volunteers are a #5 on last page. They are the greatest"
"The employees were not engaged when i visited. I tried to ask a question and they clearly did not want to be asked. This was on a previous visit in the summer of 2016"
"The facilities and services are very good."
"The facilities are always clean."
"The facilities are great and very well maintained. I appreciate the kind volunteers in the welcome center and the staff maintain grounds beautifully!"
"The facilities are wonderful. However, the visitor center can be difficult to locate since it is far from the refuge. I understand the need to limit access to ensure the security of the wildlife, but it would be very nice to have walking paths along theshiawassee river, and some limited kayak access to the river as well."
"The facilities at the nisqually refuge headqtrs are excellent including toilets, the toilet at the boat launch site is kept stocked with toilet paper, but the facility has not been improved in years."
"The facilities at this refuge are excellent. Having accessible restroom facilities is important. Having trail and birding opportunities is an absolute! And this refuge is one of the best i've experienced!"
"The facilities were all in excellent condition and the staff was very friendly and helpful"
"The facility is well maintained and operated. No complaints."
"The grass along the roads and trails could be mowed more frequently."
"The great meadows is a gem. I'm so happy to have a beautiful place to walk in the morning"
"The hand sanitizer was out in the men's bathroom."
"The hardest part was figuring out if we had to pay a parking fee (we had an america beautiful pass) and the volunteers at the ""visitor's center"" (if that is what it was) were very helpful"
"The hiking trail is very poorly maintained. It's dangerous and slippery, but such a beautiful, fabulous place for a hike and exercise."
"The information for the boat tours was hidden almost didn't see it"
"The kayaking trail here is one of my favorite in the area. I'd like it more if it were expanded or somehow separated from motorized boat traffic."
"The limited hours for reserving camp platforms made planning difficult"
"The local friends group is very active and inspiring"
"The longer trails are in some areas i wasn't sure if they'd be safe"
"The lotus at the great meadows refuge in concord, ma is being overrun with lotus. There used to be maintenance of keeping the water open so that you could see/observe/photograph all sorts of waterfowl in any season. Now, the lotus clog the water and there is just one narrow waterway kept open down the middle. This is a shame. There should be more $ available for this refuge to control this introduced and non-native plant. (Having some of them is fine - but they have overrun everything.) The refuge has controlled the purple strife - so that was a good effort."
"The management staff does an excellent job maintaining steigerwald fwr."
"The marsh may have a visitor center, but if they do, i've never seen it and don't know where it is. I have only ever visited one stretch of roadway in the refuge and am unaware of any opportunities to hike, bike, etc."
"The most important suggestion is to provide maintenance for the boardwalk--at this point, it would be difficult to navigate some areas for mobility impaired persons because of the state of disrepair. A visitor center with a dedicated employee would alsobe nice. The signs currently present provide good information, but are not as helpful as having a good visitor center. In the future, it would probably be nice to add some more trail areas. Overall, this was a nice ancillary stop to our visit to new orleans."
"The new boardwalk is fabulous! Love the viewing platforms and signs."
"The new kiosks and maps are great. the new launch for boats also great it took a long time but so happy launch is fixed. I hope nwf acquires the adjacent 130 acres that could be part of the refuge to expand opportunities and increase wetlands protection."
"The number of out of state hunters needs to be limited"
"The observation deck had a viewing scope but was subpar. We stopped by on a whim and didn't bring binoculars with us, it would have been nice to use the scopes on deck, but they were in poor condition. We will be back and bring our binoculars."
"The office & main areas of the refuge are closed on weekends, which is the most important time to be open for many (most?) People."
"The okefenokee adventures staff is extremely professional and helpful"
"The one volunteer who's been there far too long is an arrogant bully who should be  replaced asap."
"The only downside to pinckney is lack of toilet facilities. Porta potties would be great in improvment"
"The only folks i saw or talked to were the folks asking if i'd completed the survey"
"The only problem is the people who leave their trash all over the place."
"The only sour note of our experience at the nisqually wildlife refuge is knowing that hunting and fishing are allowed."
"The opportunities for school groups to engage and learn from refuge staff have greatly been enhanced the last couple of years. Thank you for that! I always enjoy how welcoming and willing to share their knowledge the staff and volunteers are at the refuge."
"The original concord refuge is the only significant site for birding. First time visitors who use the interweb are directed to refuge hq 10 miles south in sudbury which is very poor site for birding."
"The park could use some updated restroom facilities! Especially on the outside of the check-in center by the boat dock. That bathroom is so small and the toilet is really low and difficult to use, not to mention, there is only 1! And even the restrooms close by in the picnic area could use an update inside. The building is ok, but the inside, while usable, is just not as convenient or comfortable as the newer, modern facilities that are being put in the state parks."
"The parking lot at cane bayou could use some re-surfacing and there are numerous downed trees partially blocking easy access down cane bayou."
"The parking lot had a lot of big pot holes."
"The permit box is all ways empty during season so we i bring a new person with me hunting we have to go to augusta to get a permit. The signs coming in to the refuge need to be more clear about what time you can enter the boat ramp area."
"The personel that work at our center is very nice, happy & helpful all the time."
"The primary use of the funk wildlife area is upland bird hunting. There is very very little waterfowl in the area anymore. Over the years the pheasant hunting has been pretty productive but now starting this month they are flooding major areas of the property for waterfowl.... there is no waterfowl including. Some standing water is great for all game but not the huge areas they are flooding."
"The prime hook refugee is a little oasis of nature and peace just minutes from a hectic roadway. It is a much needed safe haven for local and transient wildlife and human visitors, too."
"The refuge closes at 4pm which is two hours earlier than is convenient for most people. 6pm or sundown would be a better closing time."
"The refuge employees were very kind and knowledgeable and provided suggestions for locating birds. The facilities were very clean and well maintained. Overall, a great experience!"
"The refuge has three trails. The river trail is overgrown and the river has eroded the parts of the trail closest to the water. I would like to see the trail cleared and rerouted where the erosion has taken place. Other than that i love the refuge and everything about it."
"The refuge i visited did not have a bathroom. While i knew this to be the case before arrival others were surprised."
"The refuge is designed as a back country experience with limited facilities etc. which they are doing a good job of. If not intent then doing a poor job. Was very difficult to find much info from refuge."
"The refuge is not well maintained. Grass never cut lilly pads are all over the lake, and it's dangeroud to fish because the college students feed the alligators so they are very territorial."
"The refuge need financial support from the parent government agency!"
"The refuge needs an exterior source for fish, clean drinking water for cyclist when center is closed."
"The refuge offers a good, level hiking trail with opportunities for viewing migratory birds and a few turtles. I don't think it needs to be improved as there is probably no way to increase the numbers or types of species that appear here."
"The refuge offers a variety of opportunities hiking, biking, boating, camping at a variety of times daytime, nighttime and seasons. The park is well run and a magical place to visit. One of a kind."
"The refuge seems to be in good condition at all times. I am happy to have the opportunity to enjoy it!"
"The refuge should expand opportunities and facilities for non-consumptive users (birdwatchers, etc....). Most of the refuge is closed to these users while the areas are open for hunters."
"The refuge was much better for birdwayching, other wildlife observation, and hiking/trails, our main interest before it was ""restored""/changed drastically nearly a deacde ago for salmon protection. The trails and access were reduced. the dike trail has no benches and no shade or place to sit and offers little opportunity. We still grieve for the refuge as it was, with bountiful cottonwoods since chopped down, and with beautiful long trail that followed along the nisqually river allowing more birdwatchingand other wildlife observation such as seals, minks, weasels and more. The ring dike trial, now gone, was wonderful marsh trail with singing marsh wrens and more. The birds have greatly reduced. The distance to the dike trail over the water is too farand too sunny and the one-way traffic is too crowded to allow good bird-watching as too many local families use it as city park now, running and even using beach balls. The addition of a playground is absurd use of wildlife refuge property and inconsistent with its purposes; it should be removed!  The mcalister creek trail still exists and should be reopened for public access. Let people spread out more with more open trails. The refuge should stay open later at night to allow viewing the sunset and watching/listening for owls."
"The restroom facilities are operated by the adjoining county park. They are definitely inadequate and need a serious upgrade, as in complete replacement of the building. That is the one big drawback of this premium wildlife refuge area, the dungeness natl. Wildlife refuge."
"The restroom facilities were poorly maintained and had no toilet paper available."
"The restroom of this refuge is not clean enough, the smell is very bad, especially in summer. This is one of the main reason that we are not going to stay long there."
"The restrooms are always clean. The trails are very nice & a great opportunity to stretch legs on a trip."
"The restrooms are appalling"
"The restrooms are heavily used due to highway 14. It would be good if the state of washington and/or federal highway money could be dedicated to helping maintain what is essentially a rest stop on a busy highway, and which accumulates quite a lot of use unrelated to the refuge visitors. The fact that they are pit toilets is particularly unfortunate with the large amount of non-refuge use going on.  When i have run into refuge staff or volunteers they have always been well informed and courteous, but there simply are not enough of them to deal with the number of visitors.  There is no visitor's center here, though there was originally plans for one. It would be useful to have one."
"The restrooms at the visitor's center are always very clean and equipped. The two portable potties near the twin barn and sometime clean and sometimes not. Sometimes the hand sanitizer is empty. What i would really like is to have another portable potty before starting the boardwalk. This makes it difficult for me to continue to the end of the boardwalk and finish the bird walk with the other birders."
"The restrooms could be cleaner."
"The restrooms were not up and running"
"The restrooms, esp. the men's, need to be fixed (men's bathroom had half of the ceiling/insulation on the floor."
"The road through ding darling was closed on fridays which we did not know, however the staff explained why it was closed. They explained areas we could use to walk through the area."
"The room with the drawers of bugs and dung was very interesting. Book store qith stuffed animals was amazing."
"The san diego bay national wildlife refuge is limited to trails for walking and birding that are new and does not have additional features. As local residents, we use the trails daily for dog walks, aerobic exercise and commuting to work via bicycle."
"The section on how much money was spent in the area is not applicable in my case. I could walk to the wildlife refuge from my home. It's simply a place i like to visit on occasion for a little piece of mind and relaxation. I might be interested in small boat access in the future."
"The sewers are not yet usable"
"The size of this wildlife refuge is impressive. The facilities are high quality."
"The staff and volunteers were wonderful. The refuge is absolutely beautiful. We will be back to visit again."
"The staff at hagerman NWR is fantastic! Love them!"
"The staff is always welcoming and helpful. I wish the refuge was open longer especially with the amount of time it takes to arrive. It closes so early that we don't get to see the beautiful sunset. I would love to get my kids involved in the educational opportunities of the refuge but i find it hard to find information or advertisements on such opportunities."
"The staff is great, the restrooms are always in great condition. I love this place!"
"The staff was excellent. The restrooms were always very clean. Love camping here. The kayaking is superior...."
"The tennessee national wildlife refuge has allowed the deer population to be decimated on the refuge. The opportunities for deer observation and enjoyable hunting have been exponentially decreased over the last 15 years with the refuges deer management strategies. The deer used to be one of the main attractants to the refuge with multiple people driving to observe the numbers of deer as well as the large mature bucks the refuge would grow. Friends of mine from as far as 100 miles from here comment on how they would visit the refuge recently and were shocked that they would see zero deer now. This deer decimation program has also affected surrounding private areas and the local landowners from having more opportunities of deer harvest because the refuge hunters will have to first shoot a doe before harvesting a buck. The hunters have been allowed to use rifles in this flat land, which i really don't know how someone has not been shot accidently, and their hunting technique now is to walk the overgrownfields and ditches and jump deer and shoot at them on the run. This has led to many deer being wounded and left to die. They hunt this way to try and get their doe so they can concentrate on a buck. I don't know why though, because there are so few deer left there its not worth the efforts. When they first started allowing bow hunting, then muzzleloader only hunting, the tNWR was one of the premier hunting destinations in the state and people from all across the state would apply for the permits. Now it is looked at as a waste of time to even apply for. I understand the refuge is designed for waterfowl management, but it used to be so much more(better) for all opportunities and still held incredible waterfowl numbers."
"The tualatin valley national wildlife refuge is a valuable resource to the wildlife and the people of the pacific northwest. The only critical comment i can offer is to remove the disturbing portrait behind the counter at the visitors center."
"The unscheduled closures are a big pain. This time, we were on our way home to the detroit area from up north, but it was a few miles out of our way. If we were coming from home, we'd have to remember to check the website first."
"The very best experience was the wonderful guide that lead our boat tour. He was knowledgeable, interesting and observant. We saw many things that we probably would have missed if he had not pointed them out! My only negative comment would be that the sign from the cabin to the boardwalk made no mention of the fact that it was much shorter to drive, which we discovered much too late. Several other older visitors were out of breath on the return trip and would have appreciated driving."
"The view from this location is gorgeous. I proposed to my wife during one of the beautiful texas sunsets at this location, my family and i visit here often."
"The visitor and education center waas terrific. The whole place is geen environment. The restrooms were immaculate"
"The visitor center at ottawa is top notch. The restroom facilities are beautiful and extremely well maintained!"
"The visitor center closed @ 5 pm - too early so we could not go in. Website says refuge closed @ sunset. Visitor center should have been open @ least until 6 pm during summer tourist season."
"The visitor center is excellent - very well maintained and informative - the staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Blackwater is our ""go to"" refuge area - being on the migratory bird path, we always see a wonderful variety of birds in their natural habitat. Additional pull-outs would be helpful but overall, we love the refuge and will continue to come back for many years."
"The visitor center is exceptionally nice."
"The visitor center is in a diffferent location. Due to experiences for wildlife observation, kayaking, fishing, cycling, hiking and simply being inspired by the majesty of the area, we bought a home near here"
"The visitor center staff was amazing in getting me started on my activities."
"The visitor center was closed and the outhouse restroom was gross"
"The visitor center was only open 4 days/week - not on the days i visited. It looked like an interesting building but i had no opportunity to get inside. Since volunteers are mostly staffing these visitor centers, why not engage more of them and have these resource investments open full time to the public?"
"The visitors center at desert NWR if new and really nice."
"The visitors center was excellent. We stopped without doing any advance research so the information we found at the center was invaluable. We were able to see animals and plants that we wouldn't have known about without stopping there. Great facility and very helpful staff."
"The visitors center was shut down due to the federal government so it was disappointing to not be able to visit it, talk with the park rangers, and enjoy all the center has to offer for additional educational opportunities and shop to help support it. Wedid enjoy bird watching on the outside patio."
"The volunteer at the visitor's center was extremely helpful and guided us through the exhibit, provided information about trails that would be suitable for our toddler, and in general provided exceptional service. I was so impressed."
"The volunteer was very friendly and helpful. The visitor center was closed. Our group of five could only stay a short time. We only walked and observed the wildlife it was very enjoyable"
"The volunteer were very helpful & informative & educated about the site"
"The volunteerd are very helpful, trails and restrooms are well maintained"
"The volunteers are always friendly and helpful. Toilets are always clean."
"The volunteers at the refuge are great!! Very friendly, helpful and informative, and it is good to see how much they care about this special place and about environmental issues generally."
"The volunteers were helpful and courteous."
"The waterfowl blinds used for the youth hunt was very good. We had blind 72 it could/should be moved 150 yards closer to the lake. It was very good to have a john boat available to help take decoys and equipment to the blind."
"The whole area has changed unbelievably since i visited 10-20 years ago. It iw totally modernized . and up to date, but lost some of it's charm and wildlife doesn't abound is the same way as before. No frogs to be seen or heard, pond had be cemented in and cat-tails, bullrushes banished! A sterile place compared to the past. Just like in the song ""they've paved the parking lot, etc"" retired teacher of the gifted and talented, las vegas, nv. Imho"
"The whole family loves pinckney island refuge. It is well maintained and simple so you can really enjoy nature."
"The wild & peaceful aspect of trNWR is its major appeal-many species here, peaceful and yet, near large city so it's accessible. Please do not create loud, narrated bus service w/tours in the refuge! And thanks for additional out house/restrooms at the end of refuge!"
"The wildlife drive should open by may 1st each year. Not june 1st as it is now. Possibly stay open till october 31st."
"The wooden platforms for trails is severely deteriorating & needs attention. Have been coming to this area for many years & wooden platform trails are on steep decline."
"The youth waterfowl program that was put on was fantastic. I can not express how well run it was and the amount of volunteers and wildlife officers that came together to put on this program for the kids."
"There are a few docks at campground area that set dormant for no reason. More places to buy ice without traveling a great distance"
"There are few facilities here but they are fairly well maintained. As long as the trails/boardwalks are maintained and the restrooms serviceable, i am satisfied."
"There are large areas of the refuge without any hiking trails. I'd like more trails"
"There are no bathrooms at all"
"There are no facilities at this refuge. Only outhouses at certain locations and they are nasty."
"There are no regular staff as welcomers. There were no animals to be seen. Trails need to be changed to observe animals!"
"There are no restrooms. Not even portable toilets. Toilet paper and people urinating around the tree line near the parking lot is very common."
"There are no roads w/in the refuge that i am aware of so questions about buses, trams and roads are moot"
"There are no services, facilities, or opportunities at this refuge"
"There are none."
"There are very few places for fishing access. With valid fishing permit you should be able to go off trail to fish"
"There aren't any services or facilities offered."
"There aren't many services since this is an uninhabited island in the middle of a river"
"There doesn't have to be a visit center - but there really does need to have rest room facilities"
"There has been less wildlife to view. It seems the wildlife count has fallen off over the last 3-4 years. Has something changed? I live close and can go about once a week and this year has seemed unusually void of numbers of wildlife."
"There is a nice city park adjacent to the refuge with bathrooms/parking with no refuge access that i know of. Most people park on a residential street up the hill and walk past several residences to enter the refuge. which probably annoys them on a dailybasis. I would look into creating a clearly marked trail head from the chula vista park into the refuge."
"There is a parking area at the top of the mountain accessed by freeland rd - forest rd 80 on canaan valley NWR land that we use to access dolly sods. A few years ago it was posted no overnight parking. This limited camping access to this area of dolly sods. I wish we were allowed overnight parking there."
"There is electronic kiosk at the visitor center to record bird sightings. I have the impression that the volunteers are intimitaded by this kiosk. More people would use it if volunteers would help them."
"There is great potential to increase the number of volunteer and environmental education opportunities."
"There is no bicycling on the trails. also garbage is left from others as there are no containers to put your garbage in- if more people were around they might monitor the garbage and have those leaving it pick it up themselves. love that fish and wildlife were there writing tickets to those who had fished without a license!"
"There is no opportunities at this lake besides fishing because that is the only thing you can do. There is no reason why this lake is not open to boating, camping, swimming and so on when they took that from the the lake they might as well have drained itbecause that is what it done to phillips county."
"There should be a covered area in case of bad weather, and a restroom."
"There should be at least one porta potty at the bedford site !"
"There used to be signs explaining the rules of staying in your vehicle, as it reduces the stress the animals are under and allows all visiting to see them. When the signs were removed i noticed an increase in people harassing animals following them aroundon foot), specifically a family of owl, preventing them from feeding. I wish the signs would be replaced."
"There was lots of trash all over the place and the trash bins were full."
"There was no running allowed however 3 military aircrafts flew over causing all the animals i hide."
"There was no toilet paper in the woman's rest room"
"There were no services that i could find"
"There were plenty of viewing devices to view the birds and scenery. There were beautiful views for great photography."
"There were so many lilly pads in the lake it was very hard to canoe out"
"They are escellant"
"They are severely understaffed for the amount of visitors they get and the work that needs to be done on the refuge."
"They close the road from oct 1st till april. I don't feel this is necessary, as the birds are well aquainted with people. So they will still nest as we walk through"
"They could add boardwalks on hiking trails that are wet/ flooded. Sometimes you hike a couple miles and run into a flooded trail and have to turn around."
"They need to expand the archery only deer hunting area to include the entire north shore and area west of the overlook (closed area). They also need to suspend the earn-a-buck requirement until the lake level decreases, which will create more security cover for the deer and increase the number of deer on the refuge. In 2018, i typically saw more deer off refuge than on refuge, in my 11 days of hunting and observing with binoculars. In 2018, had more hunts where i didn't even see a deer than in previousyears."
"They need to resume planting crops in the fields to attract deer and waterfowl to the area. This was done in the past and now the fields are growing trees and there is no place to observe wildlife. People using motor vehicles have decreased due to lackof visibility of wildlife."
"They need to start mowing, dirty toilets"
"They should not allow hunting. This is an urban area."
"This facility has no restroom orr visiotr center. Information is very scarce. On occation there is not even trash facilities. It could be a much more enjoyable area if some improvemants were made."
"This facility is well-designed and maintained at a high level. Easy access to ""the spit"" and adjacent lands."
"This is a basic wild space/refuge with few, if any amenities - which is generally fine with me, as someone who likes to just get out and explore."
"This is a beautiful gem and i loved visiting! The info about deconporing about each type of material was great"
"This is a beautiful place to walk. We are fairly new to the area. We have been here twice. I really wish there was a nature trail from our neighborhood heading south along the tualatin river, so we could walk to the refuge."
"This is a beautiful site."
"This is a beautiful well-managed area that provides opportunities for visitors from other parts of the country and world to experience an important part of the chesapeake bay and its environs in a natural state. It also makes it possible to imagine life among the native americans and the underground railroad."
"This is a beautiful wildlife refuge but during the summer, all the weeds, bushes and vines grow along the shoreline and make it really hard to see anything on the water. If you could just clear out a few areas for viewing would be great. Thanks"
"This is a dark park for night sky observation. We had perfect conditions for viewing. In may we used the suwanee river for a trip in north florida. Nice to see the park we are visiting connected to other mwa's"
"This is a fabulous resources currently being developed; however, some individuals are working against ""us"". Damage to the preserve is escalating and it appears there is no abatement plan. Damage comes for several sources including but not limited to families (children), dog walkers (not cleaning up), skateboarders, cyclists (that do not heed signage) to outright vandalism and unfortunately the homeless.  This is a great natural resource deserving continued development and more importantly (at this time) serious protection."
"This is a favorite walking place, different in a seasons. Restrooms are not always kept up"
"This is a great facility"
"This is a great place. Small, but well run"
"This is a lovely refuge. I've live within a few miles of it for 10 years and only learned about it in the last year when my daughter hiked in it. If she hadn't, i still wouldn't know about it. It's lovely."
"This is a managed refuge, not a national park. Hunting and fishing are important here. Many of the questions are not appropriate"
"This is a small refuge w/o staff there was ample information. We did not need staff."
"This is a very good refuge for those with limiited mobility. Transportion to the refuge, via city bus, would be a nice addition for those that are not able to drive"
"This is a very small refuge that you walk through. So many categories in most of these questions are not applicable"
"This is a wilderness refuge. Not much applies...lol"
"This is a wildlife sanctuary where north-to-south & east-to-west migratory paths intersect. It's a wonderful site to observe, learn & respect nature. I would hate to see the natural jewel overdeveloped, though indoor bathrooms would be nice. Not hunting ever."
"This is a wonderful refuge, a gem! Thank you for caring for it!"
"This is a wonderful refuge. There are not many volunteers, but it is easily self guided. It is a great place to take children to teach them about birds and other wildlife."
"This is an unique refuge. There is camping and walking to the spit and along spit. Protected environment so can't step on"
"This is far and away my go to refuge for a quick solo walk and i often utilize the other awesome trails for longer excursions with other people.  I'm extremely thankful to have them!"
"This is my favorite place to hike. It is scenic and provides well kept bathrooms."
"This is one of our favorite local hikes and beach walks, its available all year, every season to enjoy."
"This is one of our favorite places to enjoy the lord's creation no matter what time of year. It has a calming effect on both of us and photography opportunities are abundant. We love this refuge and plan to visit again soon!"
"This park doesn't need facilities. The trailhead to the refuge is close to a town that provides sufficient facilities for anyone looking for them."
"This part of the refuge is pretty much self service. The u.s. Fish and wildlife facility is up the road a couple of miles. The people working there are very responsive to suggestions, complaints, etc. The only fly in the ointment with this refuge is thatthe users, the citizens of louisiana, are not user friendly, ie. littering, conservation minded."
"This place is a hidden gem. It's not far from home, but for some reason it's not ""on the radar"" of many local people. Our visit was a magical day - unforgettable!"
"This place is perfect already. Please do not try to make it better."
"This refuge clearly needs more funding. You can tell the employees try really hard to maintain it, but they need more money."
"This refuge does not have a visitor center or staff or charge a fee and it does not need these things, though i would be willing to pay a fee to support the refuge. Restrooms, good trails/boardwalks/etc, and good signage are all this great place needs."
"This refuge doesn't have a visitor's center, bathroom, full time staff or many hiking trails. It is primarily a bird migration area, condoned off so visitors do not get too near bird feeding and resting areas"
"This refuge doesn't have facilities that's how it should be .."
"This refuge has clean restrooms and a nice boatramp. The dock could use some work but the parking lot and grass is well maintained."
"This refuge has defined entry and route opportunities with a tie-in to a less restrictive dike trail that allows dogs, horses and bicycles from a different entry point."
"This refuge has great services that have been damaged by the ongoing government shutdown."
"This refuge has no bathrooms - very important to have by parking area & inside refuge - better bike trails"
"This refuge has two part (each about 3 miles apart across town) i use only the drive thru part as i have arthritic knees and can't do the trails a the other part of the refuge"
"This refuge is a peaceful spot on the outskirts of newport a great place to walk/run and see many birds and occasionally deer often at very close range. It is clean, safe and well maintained."
"This refuge is a small pocket of tranquility in an area that is greatly overdeveloped. I try to take my grandchildren here whenever we are visiting this area because we all enjoy watching the birds and other wildlife that are prevalent here. It is alsoan excellent opportunity to take a hike and get some exercise."
"This refuge is a very important destination for locals and a hidden gem. There are so many things to do and see there. It is never the same experience and that is what lures people there."
"This refuge is confusing. No camping, no night fishing (small campfires) swimming is a whole other mystery. (Fishing behind damn at irrigation canals open for fishing?"
"This refuge is extremely well run with many opportunities. Additional hiking opportunities would be fabulous."
"This refuge is focused on birdwatching. It does not have much local botany plant expertise. There has been a survey of the plants occurring at the refuge but pone must ask for that survey which is in a format that is not understandable by most unless oneis a botanist. The staff needs botanical training in the local flora. The staff needs a botanist on staff to train staff, volunteers and to create programs to educate visitors to the refuge in the local flora and how it plays an important role in the ecosystem."
"This refuge is more important for the wildlife than it is for me!"
"This refuge is not best place for water access for kayaking but not necessary since boat land nearby. We have not used nature centr/welcome often; we just walk trails and fish from shore."
"This refuge is rather isolated even though it is located in the city limits of new orleans and the headquarters is 30 miles away. I'm not sure that it gets the visitation to warrant a bigger presence of personnel but it would be nice."
"This refuge is undergoing significant changes in the next year or more due to land acquisition. A good part of the refuge will be closed. So some of these questions do not relate at this time to steigerwald."
"This refuge needs more platforms that extend out into the water for observing waterfowl. In the summer three quarters of the lake is not visible from the trail. Significant segments of lake shoreline are off limits."
"This refuge needs to be protected from the crazy amount of development that is going on in our community. The wildlife need space and protection."
"This small refuge limits visitation and overuse via limited parking, poor signage and restricted bicycling. The restrooms are out of the way, reducing use."
"This survey is too lengthy"
"This survey is too long"
"This survey is too long. I am quitting."
"This survey is way toooooo long"
"This survey seems to apply to much larger facilities. Ridgefield has one very tiney kiosk manned occasionaly by volunteers. So many of the questions are difficult as they do not apply!"
"This was an incredible refuge. I planned on spending 10-20 hours here over a 3 day period but ended up only getting about 2 hours sadly. The trails and wildlife were amazing here. This refuge was a highlight for me among other refuges i have seen. Itreally was a special place. The bird call signs did not work....so either get them working or take them out. When expensive signs like that don't work...it feels like wasted tax payer dollars. Keep hunting and fishing out of these amazing places please! Thanks for providing them for the public and keeping them a safe haven for wildlife and those who enjoy them."
"This was an unexpected gem. The amount of staff, services and conveniences offered were appropriate. The national wildlife refuge brand was well represented."
"This was just a ""by chance"" visit; saw the sign and came to the refuge. Didn't have alot of time so just drove through. May take advantage of available services on next trip."
"This was the first time here. As i explore this refuge, i'm sure i will partake in more of the services offered here. I enjoyed this refuge a great deal."
"Thought the visitor center closed a little too early."
"TNWR visitor center/road was built on land taken by eminent domain. People were kept off that area for years to protect wildlife, but greed caused the usfws to spend $16,000,000 for an office/playhouse"
"Toilet paper was out in the restroom at entrance to park"
"Too long to keep my attention."
"Too many questions on this survey...I give up!!!"
"Too much spraying of herbicides when people are present. Over use of herbicides now known to be carcinogenic endangers all of us but there are often toddlers on the trails during such activities. The spraying has totally ruined the wildflower population which also decimated insect populations. This makes for a war zone sort of appearance."
"Too much thick vegetation. Need some prescribed burns on rotation basis. Need to flood specific areas that have been dammed to hold water for waterfowl.. both in spring and in fall. This area is worst than it was 20 years ago... plans were made and money spent by us wildlife to improve but never carried thru... disappointment with refuge!"
"Tour guides were standing around talking. A group pushed ahead with 10 people and filled the tour. They could have added one instead they said ""too bad for you."""
"Trail in good shape. Places to stop & view, photo, rest."
"Trails and facilities are well maintained. The only drawback to this refuge is not being able to access the whole refuge for a good portion of the year. I understand the need for this to protect the wildlife but i always look forward to the time in thespring when access is opened to all the trails."
"Trails around/between some of the ponds are poorly marked. At times we veered off onto a wild animal trail thinking it was the hiking trail, only to hit a dead end and have to retrace our steps. An animal scat id sign would have been educational. Not enough landmarks are described on the park trail guide to make the guide truly useful. The benches that have been added are a plus for hikers needing rest."
"Trails need some upkeep"
"Trails walking are often overgrown with vines & foliage - possibly poison ivy - making it tricky to walk around"
"Trails well maintained some of shubs are now blocking view of ocean"
"Travel 3 hours one way to see photograph eagles were not allowed to go back. One restroom porta potty and no other rest area on drive. The other was back with eagles."
"Trees near parking areas should have dead branches removed. After hiking my son and i went back to his truck and saw that a very large branch had nearly missed it when it fell. If the branch had fallen on someone , it could of seriously injured or killedthem"
"Tualatin river national wildlife refuge has a great and welcoming visitor ctr. I believe it serves a very important function in helping educate the public in expanding their awareness of wildlife creatures and importance of habitat, and the role of humans in preserving this. Great place for kids and adults!!! It is a beautiful refuge."
"Twr is doing a great job."
"Unfortunately because of the shutdown, most of the facilties were not available to us. They looked great and would have been a nice oasis from the cold rain, but it was beyond all of our control."
"Unfortunately i did not have a lot of time to spend at the refuge otherwise i would have taken advantage of other services such as tours and boating and done more hiking. I have on my list to return when i have more time."
"Unfortunately, on the day we visited, the wind picked up and there wasn't much bird or wildlife activity due to the gusts and turbulence. We hope to return soon on a calmer morning."
"Unfortunately, our visit coincided with the government shut down. I was impressed with the exterior of the visitor center and the opportunity for wildlife viewing off the back deck."
"Upland hunting should be given more consideration"
"Used to you could see big deer and you barely can see a deer now. They dont flood and knock down food for ducks till after season which is not helpful to the area at all."
"Usfws has uncle-invested in this refuge and neglected conservation issues for yeave, esp. Growth of amer. Lotus mono culture"
"Very clean and well maintained visitor centre as well as trails. Very friendly and helpful staff as well"
"Very clean extremelyi friendly staff. Very sorry professional"
"Very clean, nice and accommodating volunteers, very peaceful area."
"Very courteous and knowledgeable staff. I appreciated all they had to offer and share with my daughter and self"
"Very friendly staff over the 12 years i have visited (every 2-3 weeks)but i miss the former earthen ""/zkes"" with the more critters"
"Very good - hrs of operation too constrained."
"Very impressed by the whole operation."
"Very impressed with the refuge."

"Very nice facility"
"Very nice place to refresh your mind"
"Very nice refuge. Great base to discover other wildlife areas nearby."
"Very nice shaded parking structure, picnic area, restrooms and visitor center. But beyond the doors of the visitor center, the experience was not as good as what i expected."
"Very nice visitor center"
"Very nice visitor center; volunteers friendly and helpful"
"Very nice volunteer tour guides"
"Very nicew area w/lots of wildlife viewing oppurtunities. I use it year round. It would be nice if the trails wer expanded to go to more areas."
"Very pleasant & most enjoyable"
"Very pretty setting. Nice views & spotting of birds. Wonderful overlook. I wonder if there is possible access to lower views or waterfront."
"Very remote, there are no facilities, staff, or buildings of any kind."
"Very satisfied"
"Very satisfied"
"Very satisfied with the hunting opportunities at this refuge"
"Very satisfied with the services and facilities."
"Very well managed"
"Visitor's center was closed on sunday."
"Visitor center and restrooms were not open when i was there, but the facility was very nice."
"Visitor center closed too early. Handicap parking was way too far from visitor center and shop."
"Visitor center employees and rangers are first rate! I would pay $400 at day for the youth waterfowl hunt opportunities, they cost $3 for a lottery ticket. Refuge is a national treasure."
"Visitor center is awesome.  Staffed by nice people"
"Visitor center is closed on weekends should be open on saturdays at least"
"Visitor center is closed saturday and sunday, why?"
"Visitor center is top notch. I would like to see enforcement of fishing regulations, such as no fishing from bridges."
"Visitor center more than adequate, trails excellent, views of nature outstanding."
"Visitor center not open until noon therefore didn't see this item."
"Visitor center staff was very friendly & knowledgeable"
"Visitor center was closed and told how impressive it was so we bummed. I think it was saturey or sunday around 11 am."
"Visitor center was small and no personnel were seen when we stopped"
"Visitor center was very informative with numerous displays of birds found in the area. Second floor observation with binoculars was nice feature."
"Visitor center was well maintained and very educational."
"Visitor center well maintained and employees/volunteers very helpful and provide excellent information for new comers to the refuge."
"Visitors center is great when i do decide to visit"
"Volunteer at visitor center was rude. She didn't seem to want to be bothered."
"Volunteers (karen and harvey) are very friendly and helpful. Lew, the guy at the guardhouse does a great job welcoming people to the refuge."
"Volunteers are great, employees are also great! Namely ""jackie britt is cool!!"
"Volunteers at visitor's center were very helpful"
"Volunteers handing out this survey were extremely helpful and knowledgeable."
"Volunteers were helpful and full of information. - sign regarding campgroun fees and refuge fees was confusing."
"Was happy there were none!"
"Water and rail system is amazing; refuge should stay open later - give people a chance to see sunsets"
"Water level should be maintained until fish spawn instead of dropping it early to benefit farmers. Drop after first week of may to benefit fish."
"Water on refuge when duck season opens. Very much needed to hold ducks here."
"Wayside entrance was unmarked"
"We always have a great time. More people should take the opportunity to visit this place. It has wildlife and history on display. With it's natural water source, the refuge has a variety of landscapes, and all kinds of desert wildlife. We saw more lizards around every bend of the trail this spring."
"We appreciate this refugee and the friendly staff in the visitor center with nice restrooms."
"We are members of oNWR and use it as often as we can.  We have a cottage just beyond the local area (50 miles) so it's not a special trip for us when we are able to use the cottage, i.e. not in winter."
"We attended riverfest free admission and parking, free fishing, free food, free programs and demos. It was a fantastic family event."
"We couldn't walk the last 70 feet of the pier to the gazebo which ruined our entire visit. That and the spider webs blowing in the wind all over the pier."
"We did not go to the visitor center on our most recent trip. Restrooms & trails near the visitor center are always well maintained."
"We did not see much water. It appears the place has been overgrown with plants."
"We didn't find anything really except a parking lot and signboard with hiking information. Perhaps there was more in another part of the refuge that we didn't know about?"
"We didnt see restrooms or a visitor center or any employees. We did see birds but could only see them from the one-lane dirt road - there were no boardwalks or platforms that we saw."
"We do not observe any services. We met two volunteers near the syh indicating that this was a refuge. It is art ideal location for a restroom with a wildlife center."
"We enjoy okefenokee because it is still a bit removed from ""civilization"". We spend a considerable amount of money (approx $2500) within a 65 mile radius of folkstone, as we always include okefenokee as part of a barrier island ocean experience. We havebrought scouts (and recommended to others) from virginia to specifically enjoy the back country canoe/kayak camping experience."
"We enjoy visiting this refuge and like it much better than desoto national refuge, ia. This refuge has closer views of wildlife with easier access. The vistor's center is close by with restrooms. The hike to the top of the bluffs is fun and has a greatview of a large area."
"We enjoy walking the trails at sauchest point wildlife refuge. We appreciate that there is a well kept visitor center and restrooms. We wish more wildlife refuges, hiking areas had restrooms and centers with programs, videosm interactive activities, and guided hikes"
"We enjoyed our visit. Had not been at this location for 42 years."
"We enjoyed the fishing opportunity provided. We had only expected to go for a walk and were happy to participate."
"We enjoyed visiting this facility very much and meeting the lovely katie who represented dept. of interior (?) And was instrumental in having me volunteer to do this survey lol. She showed us the new lighthouse at kileaua which looks more like a satellite dish standing next to the original lighthouse and is not recognizable as a lighthouse at all!  My only suggestion regarding the refuge would be to trim the vegetation down a little for better visuals just outside the fencing that follows the perimeter."
"We feel fortunate to have such a fine area in our area. Well run. An oasis!"
"We had a great experience."
"We have been experiencing much vandalism and theft at our refuge.  I am very concerned about this.  Perhaps they could install some cameras to document the offenders."
"We have enjoyed this refuge for many years!"
"We have not found a restroom as of yet. That has made visits difficult with aging adults in our vehicle. We have to leave the area completely to use a restroom."
"We have visited the refuge and visiting center before and have found them both very educational. We like to take our grandchildren there."
"We hiked the okolehao trail at hanalei, maui, hi. The trail was reasonably slippery because of the amount of rain the area normally receives. There was a fine, plastic, black mesh covering some of the trail areas to assist either with holding the soil in place during heavy rains, or to assist with traction while hiking. The cloth was bunched together in some areas so that it didn't cover the trail entirely. But the footing was okay for us in those areas. We hike to enjoy the outdoors, get some exercise and absorb the areas we visit. Opportunities for taking photos of the views and the surrounding areas is important to us. Clearing away vegetation in some key areas along the trail to allow for good photographic vantage points would help to improve our experience. For example, there is a large, electrical wire support tower at a beautiful vantage point along the trail, but the grasses and other vegetation did not allow safe access to the areas that would provide good photographs. Also, at the benchat the end of the main trail (the trail does extend beyond this point but the guide book we used, the ultimate kaui guidebook, did not recommend going further) there was a good view of the hanalei bay area but the inner island view was obstructed by overgrown vegetation which did not seem to give us the view of 1/5 of the island that the guide book promised. So, in a nutshell, we can handle trails that are a bit challenging with mud, steepness, certain obstacles, etc. But would like to be able to enjoythe reward of an unobstructed view after the climb. Overall we enjoyed the trail as it was mostly wide and easy to walk and the view that we saw was pretty spectacular."
"We just like to be in the area and learn a bit more each time."
"We just used the boat ramp. It's a big area with many access points. Love its proximity to town!"
"We learn programs through the local newspaper. If a program is not listed there, we probably miss it."
"We like it how it is so no complaints"
"We like sherburne refuge for hiking, birding, general photography and even the drive. Could use a few more pull offs on the drive. Appreciate hiking trails. The more, the better."
"We love ding darling on sanibel. We love to hike & bird & visit the center. We love that ding's legacy of conservation continues."
"We love it here -- will be back again"
"We love nisqually and have been very satisfied by how it's run."
"We love our wild life refuge!"
"We love steigerwald. It is difficult to see what could be improved while still maintaining its fundamental role as a word and wildlife area."
"We love th facilities/opportunities"
"We love the auto tour and wish there was a restroom available somewhere on the route. I wish all the roads or more of them were available to drive."
"We love this refuge! It is well maintained (other than the boardwalk for wheelchair users) and clean. Thank you."
"We love this refuge. It is quiet and peaceful and you can see so many birds. Our kids love to bring their guidebooks and their binoculars and stay for hours. We see lots of other wildlife as well which is also very cool."
"We need more restrooms...!"
"We need to have a building with bathrooms. The jon at the boat landing stinks and is always dirty!!!"
"We only hiked on one trail. Not aware of other services or facilities"
"We only sprint a short time at the refuge. Now that we know it is there and what is available, i believe we will stop there again."
"We returned to atten a tour of a lighthouse on the refuge, paying admission. The tour was full and we could not participate. Better information at entrance should be available about events within the refuge."
"We saw a park ranger picking up trash along the beach, about 2 miles into the hike. There should not be any trash in the first place, but her effort to keep the refuge clean was appreciated."
"We travelded through on a late afternoon. It was not very busy on the roads/trails, and the visitors center had already closed for the day. Still, using the site's displays (maps, etc.), we were able to enjoy our short visit and see some outstanding wildlife."
"We traveled to this facility on sunday only to find out it was closed so we made the trip back on wednesday. Good thing we went back on wednesday because we found out then that the light house tour was only held on wednesday and saturday."
"We used a portable facility because it was most convenient to use. It was okay."
"We used google maps to locate the dungeness spit. Initially, the maps took us to another location, not the official refuge."
"We visit the federal refuges in arkansas annually and plan a couple of family vacations around it. I am a little disappointed in the federal refuges following the arkansas game and fish yearly rule changes that are specifically targeted at non residents.example is use of motion waterfowl decoys. i think that the ability to take game legally should be allowed. We are seniors and constantly using a jerk string gets rather old and tiring. I certainly hope the refuges don't follow the agfc on limiting access to non residents.  Thanks"
"We visit the refuge when we are near it.  We may have been around it more than 6 time this past year.....We try to visit for migration and deer and what ever kind of birds are in the air-we miss the old signs squaw creek.....History should be part of thesign structure.thanks for being there for missouri loess bluff."
"We visitied on a sunday. Didn't encounter many park workers or refuge volunteers, except for young man from the ohio state/usfws survey"
"We were camping at janes island state park. We heard about the refuge from another camper. Since we had our bikes we decided to go spend the day at the refuge. A great resource."
"We were completely satisfied with ridgefield wr all we met were helpful. It was well maintained & a beautiful setting for visitors and more so the wildlife"
"We were disappointed to find out how late the park opened. For birding, the earlier the better."
"We were geocaching and really enjoyed the opportunities in this park."
"We were not able to access the visitor center after walking thru the refuge, because it had closed for the day. I wish it had stayed open longer."
"We were passing through on our way from orlando to chattanooga. Two of us had visited the okefenokee in the early 1970's during the spring from folkston. It was terrific. Lots of reptiles big and small, lots of water, and we rented a boat and took a lunch and we were gone for the day. Not so good entering from fargo. Low water and not much wildlife. We walked the boardwalks and saw very little."
"We were surprised that the visitor's center was not open on weekends. Makes it hard for families to visit."
"We were very pleased with the refuge because it is so beautiful, tranquil and welcoming. It is our special place and are grateful for its presence so close to use. We can't wait to come back for a visit again."
"We were very satisfied."
"We wish some of the trails remained open later in the autumn season. Some of these are closed on a certain date and not reopened until the following spring."
"We wish the grounds was open on sunday. With all the flowers, trees and trials, this is a very nice area to walk the dog or just to spend time together."
"We wish you could provide tour guides or visitor center is open to give more guidance to give some information of the place"
"We would have visited the visitors center, except the government was shut down."
"We would not encourage expansive development. We like it as it is."
"Well maintained.  A pleasure to visit. Beautiful displays. Well done."
"Well marked water trails and a nice map are helpful. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Beauty is everywhere in the swamp."
"Well reun so far"
"Well, there are no facilities at this unit, so maybe a bathroom would be a good idea. More wildlife viewing platforms of boardwalks would be wonderful."
"What about this at a refuge. I now they are not parks but... https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-5gzlsn"
"What keeps me from going here as often as i would like is that it is secluded and there is not a surveillance system or a way to check in visitors. I understand it would be an extra expense but there have been times i have driven away instead of parkingand enjoying the park because of suspicious looking people hanging out in their cars in the parking lot. It would be nice if it was posted that the parking lot was under surveillance or something like that."
"When driving, the entrance suddenly appears and twice i've nearly missed the exit. There is a good sign at the entrance but it would help to have warning sign on the highway (e.g. Refuge off-ramp 500 feet)"
"When hiking lost trail - need to cut weeds back on roadway can't see over them"
"When i go for a birdwatching trip to the area blackwater is very high on the list because of the birds. The other stuff is a plus but not the whole ballgame."
"When refuge was redone duck blinds & some trails were unmoved. Would like for trails inside how new levy reopened & duck blinds added. Would like trail added down river for 1/2 mile or so."
"When you call headquarters, very seldom is the phone answered. The recording says your message will be returned within 24 hrs, it took 2 wks for someone to call me back after i had left message 3 days in a row. That needs imp8roved on!!!"
"Where are the elk? Didn't saee a single elk on this visit"
"While, we have and still will visit it would be nice if pinckney island NWR had restrooms."
"Why not have more hunting opportunities?"
"Why so many areas closed?"
"Why were there plans planted that needed to be watered? Now many of the plants are dead? Seems like a waist of money.  Could use more law enforcement in the area for the drug use and petty crime."
"Wildlife management of this refuge declined in past year due cutting down tree & planting of prairie grass & no crops for wildlife. Very disappointed in management of this refuge."
"Will bike & canoe next visit"
"Wish more trails available. wish refuge open more days."
"Wish the bathrooms were cleaned and aired out more frequently and also that tp was available on a consistent basis (great meadows in concord)."
"Wish there was a restroom."
"Wish there was access to water ways"
"Wish visitors was open more hours. Can't bike on loop trail although may be safety issues."
"Wish we had more time"
"With the government shutdown, we were unable to use facilities, which was very disappointing and inconvenient. The refuge staff was most helpful as volunteers, though it seems they were put in a very bad position, thanks to mcconnell and trump... :-("
"Wonderful"
"Wonderful experience, plan to visit next year."
"Wonderful indoor restrooms. Questionable outdoor ones. Very limited hours at the uc, also easy to get lost on refuge roads (it might be 4 or more miles or 40...)"
"Wonderful place. Weather very hot & unforgiving, & too worried about ticks (plentiful) to leave paved roads. Deer ticks are a big problem. Would have rented canoes with more time."
"Wonderful place...it is my refuge from the busy world"
"Wonderful refuge and facility that we use often."
"Wonderful refuge that we go to each time we visit"
"Wonderful staff & volunteers. We also enjoying sharing information with other visitors."
"Wonderful staff. Always a great experience."
"Wonderful visitors center. Lots of information and friendly staff."
"Working restrooms would be greatly appreciated."
"Would appreciate auto route opened at all times refuge is open."
"Would be nice if drive through could be open for part of october as it used to be - to allow opportunity to see more migrating birds"
"Would be nice if open for morning hunt, as they only offer afternoon"
"Would be nice to drive in the marshland bird area ... it's very restricted. There isn't much to see our doors without driving back to see the birds and scenery."
"Would be nice to have a porta potty at the start of the boardwalk."
"Would be nice to have cleaner bathrooms w/toilet paper."
"Would enjoy ""rest stop"" of sorts w/snacks"
"Would enjoy availability of more naturalist programs."
"Would enjoy more full day bus/van opportunities to other preserves or sanctuaries or refuges."
"Would like a few more sitting areas to observe wildlife for a length of time, particularly at the ibis pond"
"Would like a walking/hiking trail from visitor center to the refuge."
"Would like food and drinks for sale should we be hungry and want to stay longer, like vending machines."
"Would like more trail maps posted along the trail. 'You are here' map would have kept me on the trail that i wanted to stay on, rather than take a wrong turn and going a bit longer than i had prepared for."
"Would like more trails open year-round."
"Would like to have clean restrooms (not outhouse) open on the weekend"
"Would like to see access to the lake! Access to the lake is extremely limited in the area. Maggee march has been closed all year. Ottawa national wildlife, has no access to the lake."
"Would like to see more benches for one to rest and enjoy the view - currently only 1 bench in parking area!"
"Would like to see more hiking trails"
"Would like to see more hiking trails in both ridgefield units and also more wildlife observation blinds. closing trails during fall and winter in the cary unit seems to have no benefit to the wetland birds."
"Would like to see more of the refuge opened up for more use"
"Would like to see new items in gift shops, with a lot more to look at"
"Would like to see some short trails off tour road that would allow me to get closer to shy animals to photograph, with out interfering with traffic on roadway. Some times taking a photo has to be rushed, as not to get in others way. This would only befoot traffic."
"Would like to see the trails and refuge better signposted."
"Would love guided bike & hiking tours"
"Would love to be notified earlier about the free rental for binoculars from the visitor center."
"Would love to see more shuttle tours of areas where only hunters go. While i recognize the importance of hunting and the establishment of refuge and their support of conservation, there are many times more people interested in visiting the refuge for other purposes. I would also recommend paving at least a portion of the road - i wrote an ea for another agency for a road along a steelhead river. We found that the fugitive dust can be more harmful to the aquatic environment as long as runoff from the roadis managed properly. The long straight stretch between the entrance station and the gate where hunters go comes to mind."
"Would love to see the visitor center open more hours and perhaps coordinated youth program/guided hikes for pre-k t"
