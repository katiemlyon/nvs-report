"'- Have events & programs in the early afternoon instead of in the morning when more birds and animals are active along the wildlife drive. Given a choice, i always pick seeing seeing birds and animals in the morning over the excellent programs which happen at the same time in the morning. - have a couple wildlife drive days, or part of days, during fall hunting season when its currently closed. - volunteers don't always know things like what the hours are, what wildlife is being seen & where. Perhaps alittle more training or way for them to know about stuff present or happening at the refuge including other oNWR locations like boss, stange rd tower, prairie, and others."
"(I already completed and returned the survey originally sent to me. I received a second letter in the mail stating osu had not received that survey so i'm filling this out again. I thought i'd mention this in case you for some random reason receive my original survey and the answers are different.) We love the tualatin river national wildlife refuge. I often take my children there once a week. My two year old recognizes it whenever we drive by it and immediately asks to go there. My kids love walking on the easy trails, exploring the terrain and seeing various birds and the occasional wildlife. I appreciate the big, open parking lot that instantly gets us on the trail (or to an overlook of a pond) and the well-maintained trails which are double stroller friendly. I feel completely safe out there and i love being outside with my kids."

"1 put up lights at launch. Too dark 2. Add another boat launch 3. Police the launch crabbers park cars & block flow of luanch. Put more signs up not to block flow. 4. Police launch. Crabbers fish off dock we have to moor to let people out of boat picked up a crab net in my prop. 5. Have anette taylor out there serving donuts & coffee at the launch at 5 am. Every sat & sunday because she is so cheerful that early in the morning. Love ya ginger"
"1) great meadows is a favorite place because of the big sky (we live in the woods). Star-gazing is a possibility; solar lights for safety. 2) i have arthritis in my feet, and would appreciate more frequent benches. 3) a cooperative program with south bridge boathouse might be fun. Mention that canoes can be rented there. Let them provide river tours past the refuges and local culture."
"1. Dungeness refuge was not a primary destinational but a welcome one. We live in chicago & a 1) day trip was to olympic peninsula & victoria. Guidebooks & local brochures led us to the refuge. 2. This questionnaire doesn't take into consideration where the visitors come from - many questions are worded for local people, not out of town/one-time visitors. How do you analyze this infor without that detail? I'm not impressed by your research!"
"1. More parking 2. Security to prevent vehicle break ins 3. Improve biker/hiker traffic"
"1. No restroom 2. No cover decks to go sit down to protect the heat from the sun while you are enjoying or having frun for fishing or crabbing. 3. The place is nice you can see any kind of birds"
"1. Visited this and many other NWR's as part of a 9,200 mile trip from pa. 2. Visited more out of curiosity than birding since visited in summer. 3. Generally - the more bird species, i think, viewing towers, benches the more likely i am to return. 4. Generally, (this is most other NWR's) the bigger problem is signage on raods to a smaller NWR, i.e. Where it is located & how to get there. The biggest help for me is a usfaws map of the NWR's through the country. But this map shows the NWR is in the nw corner of a state & give mailing address - both of little help when driving past a NWR and would like to check it out."
"2nd survey i have completed"
"A beautiful place that we enjoy visiting during different times of the year."
"A break water wall or similar is badly needed to safely use this launch during windy periods(often)and it could include a transient dock for temporary mooring which would facilitate safe boat launching since high tides, wind and waves and no beach contribute to damaged watercraft."
"A few concerns regarding steigerwald: i've noticed a significant uptick in people walking dogs on the trails, large disruptive family groups including raucous and destructive children, and visitors walking or otherwise trespassing in areas clearly markedoff-limits for purposes of wildlife and habitat conservation. I've also seen some indications of visitors riding bicycles on refuge trails (perhaps coming in from the dike trail). For whatever it's worth, i've also noticed a decrease in abundance and diversity of amphibians and insects in recent years, though this may be due to climate change, transient seasonal variations etc. Park employees and volunteers have all been friendly and helpful when i've encountered them. The gorge refuge stewards' do a fantastic job maintaining and promoting this precious natural resource via their volunteer efforts and facebook page. Thank you for all your hard work and for giving me the opportunity to participate in this survey."
"A good survey! Thank you for caring."
"A great asset to our community. in all areas of wildlife management."
"A great refuge! I wish more people were respectful of our land and environment! Thank you for all you do!!"
"A major part of this refuge was closed for maintenance. This should have been posted on their website, as well as how long it will be closed."
"A parking lot was created at the end of the road that goes down this refuge. In creating this parking lot, there are spaces that are in the blind to someone walking/riding bike/running down the road until you reach the parking lot especially when leaves are on the trees. Cars will park here and not be visible until you are right there. There has been suspicious activity here that creates some concern for safety, especially for solo runners/walkers. I understand why they created the parking area but not why they chose to park the cars in a blinded area."
"A really cool place and very friendly people. Thanks for being there!"
"A valuable resource that vould use funds to remain effective in use as well as preservation for future use."
"A very clear and accessible survey. Perhaps some question/s on pets, such as dogs, would have been useful. I had no problem hiking with my dog."
"A very special place. I have many wonderful memories with my wife, who passed away in march. We have been to many national, state and local wildlife areas and oNWR is one of the very best."
"A wonderful place for us to walk. Don't have to fight traffic crossing streets get a well tended path, lovely views and wildlife views and the ever changing foliage. Occasional visits to visitor center and everyone is friendly and ready to answer questions. A little more parking would be nice and maybe another trail somewhere for variety. Thanks"
"Access to natural areas is very limited near me, and i regard having such access as vital to my health and well being."
"Access to this refuge is convenient to anyone spending a vacation on hilton head island, sc. The undisturbed environment, fine scenery and wildlife viewing available at the pinckney wildlife refuge is an amenity equal to the beaches or golf courses."
"Access to this refuge is hampered by the lack of ""wildlife drives"" such as are found in many other NWR's. What access there is, is from public roads with few safe pull offs."
"Acquire more significant buffers surrounding the refuge. At dawn there was a significant number of firearm shots heard. I am not opposed to hunting in the area, but some of the shots heard were very close, sometimes 8+ rounds at a time, and seemed to havequestionable legality based on number of shots heard/proximity. Provide more opportunities in the urban areas and/or improve access to urban residents. Extend refuge access along stream corridors into urban area."
"Add a gender neutral option on your survey! Gender isn't binary anymore :) thanks for the survey!"
"Addition of birding stations/blinds like i've seen in europe."
"Additional walks during the migration season would be welcome."
"Again i wish the refuge would consider the use of motion waterfowl decoys within the refuge as it does on all other federal refuges and hopefully doesn't limit the number of access to non residents. The arkansas game and fish commission has proposed limiting opportunities on agfc controlled properties and has forbidden the use of motion decoys on the same, however if you are on private property, there is no such rule. Migratory waterfowl belong to us all. Thanks in advance. We love the federal refuge system"
"Again, i love this wildlife refuge. I visit here frequently and love the site. It's well maintained and a great place to bike, walk, and observe wildlife. Each time i visit i see a new creature that i hadn't seen before. It's calm, quiet, and peaceful. Please continue to support this refuge as it is important to our community."
"Again, staffing on weekends is a big plus for us, and i suspect for many visitors. If refuge professional staff cannot meet this need, it certainly beckons volunteers."
"All access is on foot, it would be good to occasionally open the further ends of the refuge via car - it is a long way to walk to the end of the island. Maybe open the roads for traffic once a week."
"Allow dogs on leashes, heavy fines for off leash dogs. Bike trails can easily be designated for bikes only so walkers don't clash with bikers. I don't feel this woudl effect the well being of the wild life. I especially feel my tiny dog should be with me."
"Allow night fishing"
"Although i live in athens, georgia, my family owns a house in st. Marys for vacation. Thus, we visit okefenokee each time we are in st. Marys."
"Although it began as a hunting site; i am glad that no hunters are allowed now"
"Although my children did not have an opportunity to participate in the program, this refuge offers an educational opportunity to students at the local middle school via use of the classroom space in the visitor center. I do know several people whose children have participated in this program who only praise the program as an excellent opportunity for their children because of the interactive learning experience and the integration of the classroom lessons with the opportunities provided by nature on therefuge. Recently there has been discussion by the local usfws district management about possibly repurposing the classrooms at the visitor center into offices for district employees. This would mean the end of the middle school program. This would be extremely unfortunate as we, as a society, are already experiencing far too many children who grow up without an opportunity to interact with nature and thus cannot relate to the importance of our natural resources. Any program that counteracts this trend should be encouraged to the greatest extent possible, especially by an organization whose primary purpose is conservation."
"Always a good time. The operation is well run by genuinely nice people."
"Anytime lands are set aside for conservation, i'm a full supporter of it. We need to make sure our children have these places to experience nature in its natural state. Whether it be a marsh, high dessert or coastline. We need to preserve these lands."
"Appreciate the new waterfowl hunting opportunities!"
"As a birder, i greatly value the wildlife refuges nears me and those i visit when i travel."
"As a native american from the local community. I enjoy using the trails to keep active, staying in shape. Also love to pick wild berries as well as the sage. Taking pictures of the big game (ex. Buffalo, deer, elk, ect.) or the owls, hawks, as well as eagles. It is a very safe place to take my children to continue helping them experience the pleasures i've seen and used as a child myself, teaching my family what i was taught as a child myself."
"As a runner with knee problems, i enjoy running on trails with sand, dirt, or decomposed granite as this surface in particular provides greater shock absorption during exercise. Ideally this specific trail would have periodic scraping or shaping to correct washouts and establish legitimate trails. There is a gate that should be open to increase the trails distance at the end of one of the main trails. The smaller trail on the other side of the stream is very narrow and washed out/overgrown in several areas. This will be difficult to improve because of the distance from service roads and the grade. The trails near the steel bridge, entrance sign, and open field area should be widened with brush clearing and tree trimming activities occurring aswell. The bridges are in excellent condition although one shifts perpendicularly during heavy rain. Of all the nature trails in san diego county, this is by far the most maintained. Jagged rocks and washouts keep me away from most other trails."
"As always it was greatly enjoyed and memorable for all the species of birds i was able to see!"
"As for me personally i feel a wildlife refuge should be just that. A place where animals both land and those in the water can be at peace and not be hunted or fished. Where the land is maintained with that in consideration. Tress left for them even if notin a growth stage. Enough acreage. Animals do need to have places where they can live and nest and be allowed just to be. The land use for species is getting critical. And on a similar matter farms being turned more and more into developed spaces and parking lots need to be factored into any hope for the future of this planet."
"As i get older, i would like to have some sort of motorized access to the trail across the impoundments and perhaps on around the trail on the right side of the impoundments. Something like the motorized shopping carts some grocery stores would be nice for people who don't routinely need such help getting around but would find such a long walk too much for their abilities. Rentals perhaps? As it is my husband and i go most often to plum island (parker river refuge) because no matter the outside temperature, which might be too much for elderly people, or arthritic problems which might preclude comfortable walking we can enjoy the landscape and see many birds along the way without leaving our car. Of course we wish we could keep on walking all the trails in any refuge but this is sadly not the case for us and many other older people. However the unpaved part of the parker refuge is a mess: incredible dust everywhere and closed half the year.    I also object to hunting in any refuge!"
"As i mentioned before, my overall experience is great. By they way i have two beehives with bees and i believe visitor would be excited if they can see at least one hive with bees 20 to 30 feet apart from the refugee road. if it necessary i can participate as volunteer in any youth-oriented educational program relating to the bees. Thank you, ico sulejmanagic"
"As i previously mentioned in an earlier comment field, i've stopped at bayou sauvage NWR many times over the years on my commutes to and from new orleans (i live about an hour east, in mississippi). On my recent visit, i thoroughly enjoyed speaking to the young people who were there to canvass visitors to the refuge. Keep up the good work!"
"As my primary interest is birding it would be good to be able to access the internal dykes to get closer to flocks. Guided walks rather than open access would be fine."
"As once stated, sure would like to be able to rent a motorized boat again; as was once available. The combination of private vendor food and services available at okefenokee is ideal in my estimation. Just the right amount of commercial venture for a refuge. The trails and roadways are well maintained and the availability of literature, both print and digital, is sufficient for planning and background information. I found the method in which this survey was conducted to be low pressure and made me feel like i could be of service to those who provide us such excellent service."
"As someone who does this for a living your survey is way too long; had to stop mid survey"
"As stated previously, just as you pass over the causeway on your way into the city there is nothing around to stop should the need arise. The refuge should capitalize on this. Build a visitors center. This would not only address a need but provide an opportunity for visitors to learn about louisianna's wildlife. This must be a popular location. Though we have never stopped here before we have frequently observed visitors fishing in this location."
"Aside from the opening time & the too hot lighthouse it was a very nice experience."
"Auto tour routes are always a nice addition to refuges. More area can be covered to see more wildlife and a variety of habitats."
"Awesome experience! Will definetely recommend this refuge to friends and family. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your survey."
"Balcones canyonlands national wildlife refuge is awesome! The staff is great, and the visitor center is very inviting. Just wish more of the refuge was open to the public."
"Ban mud boats. They destroy the marsh."
"Bank fishing too limited or unaccessible. Stocking of fish needed. Hunting also too limited or unaccessible. What little is accessible is nearly void of animals and birds like turkeys, quail and such. So unless you enjoy looking at trees and such, you arebored! Each year i spend less money and time."
"Bayou sauvage NWR could be a gem for the city visitors yet it is slowly deteriorating into an overgrown jungle along the boardwalk. The refuge needs to increase its investment into the refuge to include more on site programs, walks and education opportunities. It also needs to remove invasive species along the bayous that prevent canoeists, and boaters from using the refuge. this is not a public friendly refuge."
"Bayou savvage is beautiful and vital to the community and ecosystem. Thanks for the hard work in keeping our planet safe, flourshing, and available to the public. [name]"
"Bayoug lacombe is a great place to visit with family for fishing & crabbing. I felt a lot of the questions didn't apply to it though. It's not set up like other refuges."
"Beautiful area. Places to pull off so other cars could drive around great. Id love to see signage encouraging drivers to turn cars off while viewing wildlife."
"Beautiful area. Would like to come again."
"Beautiful place. Enjoyed our visit. The prairie dogs were adorable & funny :)"
"Beautiful refuge. Well maintained. Friendly and very helpful volunteers and staff at visitor's center. Great parking lot, roads, bathrooms. What would lead me to come back more than once a year is if there were bike trails from the closest town all the way to the refuge and if these paved bike trails were not alongside the roads. I would also come back more often if there were more hiking and biking trails. I live in a washington, dc and bike commute and when i'm out in nature i really wantto get away from cars. Thank you for doing this survey."
"Beautiful space! We enjoyed it tremendously and wish we had more time there. We arrived late in the day - just before closing. But still managed to take it in! We hope to return soon. Thanks!"
"Being a wildlife refuse, i would have like to have seen more wildlife. We only saw a few birds, no animals of any kind. Other than that, that was a really nice park. We were visiting from texas and really enjoyed our time hiking this park no walking on the beach."
"Being in hawaii, this refuge is a destination that is one part of a busy day, but it's an important part. We've been to kauai many times and try to visit this refuge each time we come. Very accessible and always glad we visit. Beautiful place with terrific facilities and staff."
"Besides attending the migrating bird day event, i have already returned to this refuge to bike along the bicycle roadway once with plans to return more regularly. I have already decided to attend the upcoming bird watching guided hike on june 2nd. This refuge has benefited from a relatively new bicycle boutique/shop and coffee shop alongside the parking area. I learned that refuge staff are primarily located at the nearby tijuana san diego eatuary south of the refuge i visited, and just north at the e street wildlife center. Thank you for gathering this information and caring about our fauna and then habitats, and its visitors. Keep up the good work."
"Best place to see gators but signs on the road could be better and the bridge to walk over the water could be maintained better."
"Big branch marsh is for me a hard place to deer hunt, not so much the terrain, but the vast swamp and pine tree stands. More so, its a great challange being it does not host as many deer as some of the ranches in west texas (so i've heard) although it ismy favorite place to bow hunt and is only bow hunt for deer legal during the 2017-18 deer hunting season i was harassed twice while over a mile back in the woods by joggers, who clearly had no idea hunting was allowed. They argued and threatened to call the law which i gladly supported, both cases neigher possessed a pamphlet of rules or a map of the reserve. One went on to take pictures of me and my vehicle and license number, one entered the woods by my deer stand while i was hunting with a huge dog intow to tell me not to hunt there. Both ruined my hunt and made me think how lucky they were that i, myself am not prone to rude behavior. As i was armed with a crossbow and admittedly i am a very patient person. If the wrong hunter were accosted miles into the woods by such ignorant people he may have regretted it, god hopes they never find out. Everyone should have a signed & read hutning pamplet on them. Everyone!"
"Billy frank jr. Nisqually national wildlife refuge has amazing trails, trees so old you can hardly see the tops, and the history of native american habitation. I found it to be a fascinating place and offers beauty and history in a huge open acreage. I loved it and will visit it again. It was clean and easy to navigate and people in the information center were informative and friendly."
"Billy frank jr. was an amazing individual and the refuge does a good job of living up to his name... I hope to see more collaboration between the refuge and the american indian population in the future."
"Bird hunting similar to what is offered on sauvie island would be welcome here, even if it was highly limited or if it was only available at satellite units."
"Birders should buy federal duck stamps. they are used to help build the refuge."
"Birding at pickney island NWR is exceptional and should be preserved as much as possible."
"Blackwater refuge is one of my favorite places on earth."
"Boardwalk needs repair."
"Boardwalks are a unique feature and well maintained! Lovely views and an appropriate amount of conservation/educational signs throughout walking trails. Some additional trail options off main loop would be nice. Great observation & photography opportunities."
"Boiler up!"
"Boundary signs, needs more, will help with property disputes."
"Can not under stand why this fantastic habitat does not draw and hold more waterfowl. What can be done to improve the waterfowl hunting? Perhaps increased planted water fowl foods? Or legal suplemented feeding. Removal of predators? Look at the stats. One duck plus a portion per hunter is poor result for this area. Thank you for conducting this survey. I'm willing to be contacted to provide additional info."
"Canaan valley is the most beautiful place. The refuge areas make it accessible to visitors as well as locals. Private property is not generally accepting of visitors. Because of being able to use the refuge, state parks and national forest here, i changed my job location and my home. I am here for the wildlife the area offers."
"Cannan valley refuge is awesome."
"Clear some grass between the trail and pond. I would love to be see more water and photography opportunity on water."
"Completed by wife (the photographer) go blue!!"
"Could not figure out how to complete survey on line or i would have."
"Could not sign on the web site??"
"Could use more benches along the trails that would allow people to sit.. so important"
"Could use some picnic areas inside the refuge other than the few tables at the visitor center."
"Could you help me identify one of the birds i took a photo of in the santuary? You can see it on my photo website at: [website]. I'm wondering if it is an eagle. It appears to only have one leg. Feel free to contact me at [email]"
"Crab orchard rocky bluff trail one of my favorites in the shawnee"
"Crap survey. Way too long and no indication f how far along i was in the survey. Awful"
"Create awareness and sponsor volunteer activities and we can drive more people to this resource. It's underutilized and underdeveloped. Perhaps underutilized because it's underdeveloped."
"Deer hunters seem to get a bad rap when hunting. They think we are just killing animals to kill. People around the refuge tell us to please take as many deer as possible as they are tired of hitting them with cars. We get our hunting licenses checked andrechecked by game wardens, federal game wardens, sheriff deputies and sometimes local staff from the refuge. This is not a bad thing. We have taught our children to respect the refuge and its rules and regulations. Some hunters do not abide by these rulesand regulations. All said and done we harvested 1- deer for 6 hunters. I am currently looking for a better place to hunt next year, if not found i may be back."
"Did submit a paper survey however you may have not received it because i should have put a canadian stamp on the envelope. Sorry for the delay."
"Didn't see any wildlife. Very disappointed."
"Discontinue the logging!"
"Do not use my info for any marketing sachuest point is a small bird watching, hike/walking trails along the ocean. Alot of these questions don't apply. It is a peaceful walking spot for a nature fix of pretty scenery."
"Don't need any more roads. This puts to much pressure on the big bucks and this is what brings people into the areas. They need rest areas like the ducks. Need pull over areas at different places on the roads that is already present and upgrade some of the present roads. Need more food sources during the winter for the wildlife after the farmers harvest their crops. Example corn, mila and etc. On refuge land. Corn is great because it lasts all winter. The corn hangs down and it is protected from the waterand wildlife feeds on it all winter. To much access by roads is hard for wildlife habitat"
"Don't think i could help much. Lo)ve the hiking trail in hanalei. Visit recently was post april 2018 floods. Would love more hinking trail in wildlife refuge."
"Duch river refuge really really nees to focus on better water levels for fishing. In humphrey county there is very little to no banking fishing for the public. Something seriously needs to be done so people will have better bank fishing opportunities. I would love to have feeback on this matter thanks, [address]"
"Due to my focus on bird watching increases in other recreation activities, particularly motorized activities, negatively impacts my enjoyment and is the primary consideration i have for visiting a refuge."
"Dungeness national wildlife refuge is a great place. Protect it and keep human impact to a minimum."
"Employees are very friendly and take good care of the environment when working. Would be nice to have trash cans so people can throw away trash. Bike trails would be nice to have a path on the trail to walk and walk your dog. Love seeing the children programs. Great opportunity to teach children how to care for our envirnomnet and the animals."
"End hunting!!!! End hunting!!!!"
"Enforce smoking laws for the health of other people and for the wildlife."
"Enjoyable this place is.!!"
"Enjoyed the park very much thank you."
"Enjoyed visit at refuge. Staff very friendly, other visitors. Had opportunity to see a great variety of birds & wildlife. Pathways were easily managed & love the environment trees, shrubs & native plants & love that so much time & effort put into offeringopportunities ofr community experiendces. Thank you"
"Enjoyed visiting with the ladies who were out working the day i drove through! Love having hagerman almost in our backyard!"
"Enjoyed visiting with young man who took my name for this survey."
"Ensure full funding for the refuge system please."
"Ethnicity is not important unless someone makes it so. I do not know how i appear to others and i very rarely care about it. I hope this survey serves a valid purpose and helps are wildlife refuges. P.s. I am not opposed to helping refugees too."
"Every time i have a visitor in town i take them to the ridgefield wildlife refuge. It is so peaceful and it is a new experience every time."
"Everything is very good, except because it's no bathrooms allowed!!"
"Excellent refuge...good access from portland. Also historic native american site. More combination of wildlife events with first-nation traditions...ex: first foods, seasonal traditions?"
"Excellent, well-maintained facility that provides opportunities to explore and enjoy wildlife habitat in our local area. I particularly appreciated the ease of access to waterways within the refuge."
"Exceptional staff at hagerman. Their attitudes, demeanor and personalities contribute immensely to the overall experience. It is apparent they all enjoy what they do."
"Excluding the visitor center the refuge could use employees around on a much more regular basis. I am there enough to witness activities that need to be reported and handled at that time."
"Filled out form online but you keep sending me hard copies in the mail so i'm filling it out again. Stop sending me more questionaires!"
"Fishing and bird/wildlife photography are my main activities and hiking occasionally. Refuge has a lot of bank access for fishing and the fishing is very good. A new refuge photo club has been recently started that is very enjoyable."
"Fix the boat ramps fire the engineer who made them, have you been to greenbriar ramp! What a mess."
"For me, as a volunteer naturalist in my area- lucas county...going to onr for the day, all by myself is like a vacation! I love it and and magee as well and so appreciate all the work that div. of f and w do to keep it so special! Its a real gem...!"
"For such a small state, rphode island has to rank up there w/ the quality & quality w/ wildlife refuges parks & management anews."
"Friends & family vacation. Son lives close by. Rented cabin. Ate meals at cabin. Visited other national parks same time. Boated. Some members catch fish & crabs. Enjoyed view of parks & refuge."
"From a birder/photographer's perspective, more places to pull off and get out of others' way would be beneficial--and would also help others move along more readily. We occasionally found ourselves ""trapped"" behind others on the auto drive when there wasno place for them to pull over."
"Fyi you have made this survey far too long and repetitive. People will either tire and not complete (like me) or rush through with little thought. Next time use a simpler tool like survey monkey and keep the survey to two or at most three pages. Figure the 3-4 things you want to determine and target them. I am a volunteer at great meadows wildlife preserve in concord, ma"
"Generally i am not concerned with limited mobility access when visiting this nwa, however, on this visit i had a mobility limitation, myself, and i was appreciative of the amount of trail available for access."
"Go blue michigan!!"
"Go blue!"
"Go buckeyes!"
"Go bucks"
"Go gators!"
"God bless"
"Going to the refuge is a pure pleasure as it is and i hope that it stays simple and beautiful. Making it more accessible for people with disabilities would be wonderful, but not adding amenities to rent equipment etc. The wildlife refuge needs to stay wild and not commercial. Thank you for the opportunity."
"Good job clearing trails, crush and run on trails, bridges and boardwalks"
"Good luck on parsing the data. Thx for supporting the NWR system"
"Good luck with using the results"
"Good luck with your research!"
"Good luck!"
"Good luck! Great football team!"
"Good place, please leave it be."
"Good thing this ended. Happy to participate, but it was getting long."
"Great experience. A well maintained refuge"
"Great meadows is an essential part of my life, almost each and every week. It is a respite from city-living, and a joy to be able to experience, though i live 30 miles away. I know its trails and wildlife by heart and have had irreplaceable memories connected with this place. I have seen wildlife there i have never seen anywhere else, and hope it remains a treasure for decades to come. Though it is abutted by a busy bike trail (which can be hard to walk due to endless bike traffic), the site is maintainedwell and thoughtfully. And despite meagre bathrooms, there's really not much i would change about great meadows, apart from maybe adding in another trail or two if possible, nearest the bathrooms. There used to be a trail there, but it is a bit ill-maintained. Thank you for asking me to take part in this survey and i would love to see the results for this location and others when it has been compiled. All the best, from massachusetts"
"Great meadows national wildlife refuge is a wonderful place to visit for adults and children alike."
"Great place"
"Great place! I have grown up on lake road (hwy434) and used to spend summers up and down it fishing and crabbing. Then the refuge came in, started regulating, kicked all the house boats and camps off the land and turned it into a turist destinaton and trainging center for the wildlife and fisheries. I understand progress is going to happen, just a little dissappointed in the way they enforce this area."
"Great place. able to unwind from daily stress, be with friends"
"Great place....wish there were more refuges nearby."
"Great refuge and i will visit again in the future in the next years. I live far away from hawaii."
"Great refuge as a side light -------go blue"
"Great refuge on guam!"
"Great refuge."
"Great refuge... main road needs to be smoother."
"Great refuge...will be back soon!"
"Great survey! Keep up the good work at noxubee."
"Great that you are undertaking this research. I would be interested in getting your results. thanks and sorry for the delay"
"Had a great time this year. We enjoy going for walks to get some exercise and observe the wildlife. We have our annual beach trip to hilton head every year for about 20 years now. We always come to the refuge while on the trip. It is fun to see how itevolves and changes. This year was better than normal. Lots of rain led to all the ponds being full which led to more waterfowl and birds than some other recent years."
"Had a nice visit to this refuge. Good trail, saw some wildlife, a few nice observation points. It was a spur of the moment decision to go with two friends when we realized we had some extra time in our schedule and wanted to get some exercise. I would return if i lived anywhere nearby but given that it takes a long flight for me to visit oregon i probably won't get back there anytime soon."
"Had a very nice visit along the auto-route. Thanks for existing!"
"Hagerman national wildlife refuge rocks!"
"Hanalei is gorgeous!"
"Happy my taxes are used to preserve open spaces & conserve w/our environment"
"Happy to help."
"Have a great day!"
"Have come to area crappie fishing for 25 years and the last 3 years the fishing has gotten worse each year. Not sure if we will return next year."
"Have firewood for campers for a reasonable fee. Consider a reservation system for at least some camping spaces."
"Having easy access to a refuge, within minutes from home encourages us to visit often and seek out other refuges and parks. Having a discount membership fee makes this an affordable outing for family members"
"Hearing hunters shooting ducks during my visits is kind of challenging."
"Heinz wildlife refuge needs more resources to serve the urban youth and low income communities with outreach and other programs."
"Hello, please do something about the american lotus infestation at great meadows! The bodies of water in the refuge are quickly turning into wetlands. Thank you"
"Hi! It was a pleasure to meet you! Best of luck as you move forward with your travels for nature an passion wildlife! Best katia from rhode island"
"High water during the growing season and beavers are killing massive amounts green timber over crowding of out of state hunters has and will be a huge problem there seems to be more restrictions every year"
"Hiking trails were badly eroded in places."
"Hope the government does not close this refuge down for the more air force land. Need the refuge for my grandchildren and future generations. Been going to the refuge since the early 70's. Have pictures of dessert sheep when they were at this site.thank you"
"Hope to walk all the way to the lighthouse next time!"
"How much did the survey cost? Did you learn anything? I didn't"
"I'd like to continue to make sure that a sufficient number of trees remain on the refuge. I support prairie work and wetland habitat but making sure there are trees for eagles and other birds to sit on is important. I also wouldn't be against a few acres having corn grown on it in order to provide more habitat/food for whitetail deer. There doesn't need to be much added but a little might be beneficial for the disabled deer hunt and for people to view them on the refuge."
"I'd love to see a boardwalk some day in the proximity of the barricaded service road off the south end of the estuary trail near the border of magee marsh and ottawa NWR."
"I'd love to see the results of this study. Perhaps the loess bluffs website?"
"I'm a photographer. Tualatin river wildlife sanctuary offers a nearby venue to combine exercise and excellent opportunity for both wildlife (birds) and landscapes, all seasons. Every time i go there's something new. Note i don't care - at all - about hybrid car parking places, nor do i subscribe to the larger global warming hysteria. I just love beauty."
"I'm glad the refuge is well used and that it still feels quiet and not crowded when i visit. This place is important to me. I'm an amateur birder and love walke/hiking in the beauty of the refuge and seeing others do the same."
"I'm glad to participate in this survey to help the management of refuges and parks. However, i hope these survey's won't make the parks feel they need to cater too much to the human visitors and forget about the residents of the forest and their needs. Keep up the great work!"
"I'm hoping this survey is just about over."
"I'm not a very ""out-doorsy"" person, but sometimes i just want to relax and feel like i'm getting away from the fast-paced city. I truly appreciate being able to take a walk at your facility! It is so beautiful and inviting. Thank you so much! Mitzi elrod"
"I'm not aware of any phone number other than the main office on lee road to call during a boat malfunction. After 5+ years fishing i have never seen any law enforement on the water, only boat ramp monitoring.i always keep my boat well maintained andwonder how a rescue tow would occur. All boat ramps should have signage explaining boater responsibilities and abilility to notify law enforcement in case of various emergencies. Gators are very prevelant and often come close if fish are landed indicating possibility some fisherman are feeding or enticing them. A gator encounter would be very negative for the future of the preserve!"
"I'm so grateful to live so close to refuge. It's a great place to hunt fish an just ride an see wildlife. They do great job at the refuge. My kid love it to be able to hunt with me an the youth fishing derby an the youth hunts"
"I'm so very glad your land was preserved as a national wildlife refuge rather than made the lake for a hydroelectric power dam. A wonderful, unique place!"
"I'm writing a book and making art prints to raise awareness about unique areas, environmental issues, and connecting to nature throughout the midwest. www.publicfieldguide.com sherburne wildlife refuge and sand dunes state forest drew me back to it after reading that there is less than .02 wild oak savanna in the midwest. (This is why i have been to so many refuges and state and national parks in the last few years, i've driven through 8000 miles through all the midwest states, hiking, camping, and writing.) Sherburne refuge and the sand dunes are very special and i am so happy that i stumbled upon it on my way back from the north shore a few years ago, after stopping at the mille lacs indian museum. Tying these points of interest together can be very powerful. Creating a map for people so that they have more than one destination. Strong relationships with museums or state forests seems like a very good idea. And a clear understanding of where the trails and points of interest are within the refuge."
"I've been enjoying hiking in hagerman's NWR for 50 years. I grew up next to it. It preserves an important portion of the areas natural condition."
"I've been meaning to get to blackwater for years, especially after my sister did a lot of serious photography there. Now that i'm retired, i finally made it. Peak experience - seeing the eagle wheeling toward its nest. Wow!"
"I've hunted funk lagoon for 40 years now. It's always been well maintained and accessible."
"I always come to the refuge for birding and sometimes lead groups of birders. We always tally the birds on ebird. Bayou sauvage NWR is an exciting place to find birds in our area."
"I always enjoy my visit."
"I am 79 yrs old and have fished kentucky lake for crappie since i was about 10 yrs old. Fished white oak, leatherwood and now fish big sandy area exclusively. I started seeing dead asian carp floating in the lake last spring. My fishing was pretty much asusual last yr. spring of 2018 was all together different. I generally fish about 2 months in the spring. This year i fished 3 trips, fished good cover but terrible results. Last year i caught more 9 1/2 inch fish than usual. This year i caught several 91/2 inch fish. So what happened to those 9 1/2 inch from last year? Did they die, starve, something eat them or just didn't grow."
"I am a bit concerned about the lotus overrunning the refuge. I think that they are invasive and i wonder if it is wise to let them take over. I worry that the diversity of species is decreased because of them. I know they must be a tough problem, and i would hate to see any measures taken that would threaten the health of the habitat or wildlife, but just wanted to let you know this is a concern of mine. It is a beautiful refuge that i really enjoy."
"I am a certified forest therapy guide. If you would like to offer forest therapy at this refuge or just talk about the opportunities, please contact me at heather@heathermariewilson.com."
"I am a retired refuge biologist and manager, including this complex, where i continue as a volunteer in the biological program with bird banding."
"I am an educator and i left the refuge with information to share with my students . Thank you"
"I am disturbed by reports i hear about the future of corn creek field station. Apparently the overall plan is to make it more ""natural."" I hear the fruiting mulberry trees that attract hordes of birds were to be removed until the public objected. Olive trees are quietly being removed. Corn creek is not just a wildlife refuge; it also contains more than 100 years of local history, and the orchard that was planted a century ago should be maintained, not removed. Terrible mistakes have been made by management. The most glorious cottonwood tree had the stream that fed it cut off, and the tree was allowed to die. The very natural pond that was full of birds, plants, and bullfrogs was replaced by what everyone now calls the bathtub, an antiseptic concrete pondthat is supposed to keep out crawdads. It is a running joke, because crawdads are some of the very few creatures that thrive there. Corn creek needs an advisory committee of users who can comment on changes before they are made and can help explain changes to the community. A few more mistakes could ruin the place entirely."
"I am german and loved it there!"
"I am glad to see this type of feedback opportunity being provided."
"I am grateful for having been able to pay $10 for a senior lifetime pass to access wildlife areas that the federal and state governments have undertaken to preserve. Thank you."
"I am local to aqvidneck island and visit sachuest point 5 to 7 times to enjoy nature and my morning hello's to other locals and tourists visiting the area. It is a safe environment which is very important to me and i appreciate all the hard work of the fish & wildlife rangers as well as the volunteers who maintain the trails and educate visitors."
"I am over 60. Thrilled to be able to hike here again after 2 years of decreased activity due to knee issues. I found the question regarding 'people who look like me' to be too vague. Treated differently by the staff? Other visitors? At the refuge? In the local area? I feel comfortable here because i have been to this location many times. Thank you for doing this important work that maintains and improves access to nature. Contact with nature is so important for health and well being. Access to areas, such as this wild life refuge, allow one to experience the fullest experience of being in nature which thereby provides the greatest benefits."
"I am pleased with the proximity of this refuge to where i live. I enjoy any species of animals that i am lucky enough to observe, but my main focus is the raptors. I hope the habitat will never be compromised."
"I am so glad to have the wildlife refuge so close & can share the experience with our grandchildren."
"I am very fortunate to have a home near blackwater. I bike there often. Once when biking with friends, two rangers helped us pull their bike trailer out of a ditch. They wer incredibly helpful. I have 5 grandchildrend - we hike, bike ant take scooters there. We all adore the place. My mother, now deceased, used to have wonderful walks there. I always think of her when there."
"I am very greatful that this refuge is in my community."
"I am very unhappy with the current federal administrations attack on our natural treasures. I have brought my children & grandchildren to enjoy the nisqually for over 30 years. I hope that people will speak up to preserved & restore our beautiful refuges,forests and parks for future generations."
"I and my family have always enjoyed this refuge. Trusting people is a very good thing. Thank you"
"I and my husband along with my brother visited the refugee to photograph bird. It has been a good experience over all. However the tolls that you pay to come to the island is a bit too much. I wish there was some system of paying the tool for a day ( every time we have to pay the tolls which made our number of visit less than what we have decided). We enjoyed our drive and were happy to see the birds."
"I apologize for taking so long to complete this survey. My wife and i were at hilton head for a week in may but unlikely to go back this way. There are too many other areas in the us to explore. :) i hope these comments have been helpful."
"I appreciate being able to visit the refuge to make art. I do wish i could bring my dog. While i do feel safe hear, it is nice to be able to get her out for a walk too. I do use a leash & understand that others do not - but if you can hunt (on other refuges) then why not be able to bring a dog. TrNWR is an awesome close to home experience. Thank you for preserving habitat! The only improvement i could ask for is a few more trail head access points. Just small ones - i like to get away from the main roadway to paint so just looking for more view points/places to be away from people. Thank you for the beautiful trails - it's really nice to get off the ""roads"" there & in the trees."
"I appreciate that the visitors' center and other facilities and activities are open on the weekends...in the past i have experienced federally-funded refuges which were not open on weekends, the very time most people are free to use them."
"I appreciate the work of us fish and game. In maintaining great meadows. It is a treasure for the public; as we walk year round, we see the effects of managing water depth, cutting back plants; sense its value for the birds. Thank you!"
"I appreciate the work they do on the habitat"
"I appreciate you placing the do not feed alligators signs up. Thank you for keeping the trash cans empty. Picked up a lot of trash from the low tide on 6/30/18. An artificial reef about 100 yards out from bayou cane into lake ponchantrain, would be great.i noticed in the straight away in the 2 towers - looks like someone cut in a boat launch or something on fountainbleu side. Thanks :)"
"I attempted the online survey. Though i had a password i didn't have an id that would be accepted. I tried my email, name and refuge name. It would be helpful to have that provided. Thanks for your work and the nice young people at the refuge."
"I authored the ohio scorp in 1980. Nice to see this survey methodology being used."
"I believe ridgefield is an underdeveloped and underused resource. The lack of safety of the entrance roadways & bridge and the minimal amenities, discourage visors. This is too bad...."
"I believe this refuge would benefit from a bike and walking trail that is separate and/or combined with the main access road."
"I believe this survey is very valuable. Thank you for conducting it. It is more important than ever that us citizens have the opportunity to visit, use & enjoy wildlife, mother nature and places that are ""void"" of commercial enterprises, noise and unsupervised. Also, geography, land/water envirnoments such as this nisqually refuge need to be guarded, even expanded so that we do not lose the animal animal & plant life that such a refuge supports. It easily could be lost/overwhelmed by commercial & grow population infringement. Mainly-thanks for listening!!! G/ 11/19/18"
"I came to hawaii from germany and it was my first visit to the hawaiian islands. I enjoyed my stay very much and above all the kilauea point national wildlife refuge where i met nene, the beautiful frigate birds, etc., for the very first time. If the flight from hamburg to kauai weren't so long and if there were no time difference of 12 hours (!) I would regularly come back !!"
"I commented that there are no trash cans at the refuge. I was told this is because the fish & wildlife service does not want the expense of emptying them. The times i have been at the refuge i have seen fws employees there driving pickups. I don't think it would be that much extra expense/effort for them to empty garbage cans & toss the garbage bags in the back of the pickup"
"I completed this survey once before. I hope you receive this one."
"I consider hagerman NWR to be an extemely well run operation with a very good regular lecture program staff fan by very knowledgeable people."
"I consider myself lucky to live so close to nesqually."
"I could not recall the exact amount i spent in the refuge and area, so those are estimates. I also was not clear about the question asking how much more money would i spend - was that total or per person, or group? So i put down a figure that i would payto visit the refuge. I really like the okefenokee refuge and bring all my visitors to it."
"I didn't realize this was a refuge. We've been here more than once. We usually just put our boat in and hang out on the river for a few hours. I'm not sure how much this helps your research but i was as honest as i could be. Some of the questions didn't apply to mebut i felt obligated to mark something. You might work on the questions or who is getting this survey."
"I dislike the fee box. I pay taxes to irs and that should cover entrance. The concord unit needs a boardwalk into the heart of the remaining cat-tail areas. I applaund recent efforts to eliminate invasive water-chestnut and purple loosestrife. Unfortunately another invasive (native in us midwest) the american lotus has invaded all open water areas. It is totally useless for birdlife. It needs some sort of effort to get rid of it and replanting of cat-tails. I applaud the decision to ban dog walking on refuge despite fierce local opposition. Jogging should also be banned except along the future rail trail."
"I do say again i, [name], want the new johnsonville refuge entrance gate to be open all the time everyday!!!!"
"I don't want to forget the efforts of the friends of blackwater - they do a fabulous job of providing information and being true friends of the refuge. We visit the refuge several times a year - our trips there are specifically to see the birds and other wildlife - we're lucky that the nearby town of cambridge is welcoming. And, the addition of the harriet tubman museum at the end of the wildlife drive is most welcome - it only adds to the cache of the refuge. Thank you for this opportunity to comment."
"I don't want to see deer hunting at john heinz. Power walking the trails has become a daily ritual. I love it."
"I encourage any surveys that lead more or better experience in nature as i see it as essential to ones wellbeing."
"I enjoy and know how lucky to have a large wildlife refuge so close to where i live. I frequently visit there after work during the summer time."
"I enjoy bayou sauvage."
"I enjoy coming to the refuge most months of the year. I am amazed how many people i see driving the auto tours in february and march. Maybe a second weekend would be appreciated during these months."
"I enjoy visiting and walking at nisqually wildlife refuge. Recently had surgery and consider myself very lucky to be able to walk in the trails at this site."
"I enjoy visiting state parks, wildlife refuges, museums. Especially if they are free, low cost. I'd love to have a camping area. Not sure about camping by the alligators. I came to see the gators and i hope to do the canoeing in the future. I'm three hours away and it's hard to find the time to visit often, but i love noxubee and plan to return as often as possible"
"I enjoy visiting the farm that my grandfather and father built up only to have the f&w steal from them after my grandfather's death."
"I enjoy visiting the refuge. There is always something to see. It is fun to meet people that share in interest in outdoors, nature and wildlife. Thank you"
"I enjoyed and appreciated the ""free"" burritoes serv ed by the volunteers. It helped on the logistics of being 16 miles away and leaving before thr motel breakfast was offered. The festival was well run and profiecently operated. And i got my two targets: golden-cheeked warbler and black-capped vireo,. It was a good trip!"
"I enjoyed it very much. It's quiet, great trails, great scenery & clean."
"I enjoyed meeting and talking with two volunteers/survey students at sully's NWR by devils lake. Pleasant informed interested researchers. Cheers"
"I enjoyed my visit and i hope taht it will be there for generations after me thanks for being there good luck in the future. I grew up in those woods as a boy i saw a lot of it cleared in the 50's & 60's and thank god almighty i lived to see it grow backup and now the government has bought it up and now it is protected by our united states government"
"I enjoyed the refuge. I really loved the boardwalks. The tree frogs were really fun to photograph. I wish there had been a naturalist on hand. I live on the other side of the county & had questions about species i had seen & nobody could answer my questions. The field guides were not very helpful as many of them were not all inclusive with species shown. I love wildlife refuges & parks. Sincerely kathy fulmer"
"I enjoyed walking through great meadows nearly every day when i lived in concord, ma but i have moved to clinton, ma so don't expect i will visit any time soon as it would be a long drive to get there now. From where i lived in concord i could walk to great meadows using the reformatory trail from monument street. What a gift!"
"I feel lucky to live so close to a national wildlife refuge. Nwrs are real treasures in our country."
"I feel that at crab orchard wolf creek area they don't want disabled persons to fish, no maintenance on docks didn't replace docks at bridge that were washed out by storms"
"I feel that fws offers a valuable service to the community and feel that this agency and the personnel at this refuge is doing the best they can with the resources they have. They need a botanist on staff familiar with the local flora to round out their educational programs.."
"I feel that this refuge is more interested in making money from logging trees than taking care of the refuge.i have had wonderful times here at cache river NWR but the administration makes it tough on continuing these great times.the roads are in horribleshape.i wish someone outside of arkansas would investigate or come down and see the conditions."
"I feel very blessed to live in such close proximity to a national wildlife refuge and have opportunities to observe animals in their native habitats."
"I find it appalling and contradictory that extremely toxic chemicals are sprayed in wildlife refuges, including the one this survey is about."
"I find the area well maintained for prairie and the burning of the land to improve vegetation growth is fierce but there are no other animals to observe such as rabbits, foxes, hawks, coyotes and so on. I noted plenty of pocket gophee mounds for food forother species. One of the things i really enjoy is seeing the geese and swarms of hatching and seeing the eagles nest with the eaglets."
"I fish for crappie in the pairs landing area of kentucky lake - 2 of the last 3 years have been horrible (2016 & 2018). In fact this year was dismal. If this trend continues i will definitely quit fishing here!"
"I found the survey a bit challenging inasmuch as it was point in time pinckney, which is one wonderful, but small part of the much larger savannah wr system. Visited sNWR and in past have also gone to other sites watches that system during my visits. Ps the folks getting the info for surveys were charming and very nice. Enjoyed talking with them"
"I greatly enjoy the public lands in the rwb district. I particulary like the diversity of birds that use the area and it extends my hunting opportunities - particulary for teal, waterfowl, snipe, rails and upland game. Usfws staff do a great job of managing a very important resource in our state and in this area i grew up in. I wish there was some additional focus on management of upland hjabitat for upland game birds - particularly pheasant/quail but understant management has to be a balance b/w waterfowl & other priorities. Pheasant hunting is likely still one of primary recrational uses but habitat quality on many areas isn't the best for pheasants. Also with more opportunities wer provided in fall by pumping. I know focus is spring migration but wetland habitat (ponded) is very limited on most public lands in fall. There are many years where wpa's offer very little waterfowl.migratory bird hunting opportunities due to lack of h2o in wetlands. Yet i also realize this all cost $ to do. Grazing is another thing that has to be managed properly & priorities must be balanced. Historically more cover was left on wpa's in fall which provided more upland bird hunting opportunitiese. In some cases grazing of wetlands also provice ver little place to hide for waterfowl hunting when we do get rain in the fall. Grazing portions of areas is ideal but i realize challenges associates w/small size of some wpa's getting agrazer to do it the way you want. I did experience one hunt this fall that i cut short becauswe tenant was loading cattle out of area (didn't want to shoot & scare cattle). Electric fences that are hot during a hunt also are not ideal - especially keeping dogs away from them."
"I grew up in the immediate area of this refuge and have always loved coming back to see the bald eagles, geese, ducks, swans, etc. Keeps me coming back!"
"I grew up near this refuge and used to work in the hay fields there. It is amazing to see how the island has returned to a more natural state is such a short time frame. The volunteer who asked us initial survey questions was very engaging and personable."
"I had a great time at magee marsh and nearby ottawa national wildlife refuge. We came for spring bird migration and we were not disappointed. It was fun watching the birds, photographing the birds and talking to the volunteers and other birders. An overall great experience."
"I had a great visit but didn't read the website about hiking being closed this time of year (oops, that's on me!) And hiking was my primary reason to visit. Next time i'll visit when i can explore on foot!"
"I had an incredible time there. What a joy!!"
"I had ankle surgery this year and this refuge in particular (ridgefield NWR) is an excellent place to visit for people with walking disabilities because of the auto-tour loop."
"I had attempted to look online prior to my visit .... however, the name of the reserve had changed and i was looking for the previous name (squaw creek). I did not locate the new name of the reserve online."
"I hate that people hunt and fish animals, and i would like that not to be available in any refuge or any park, or anywhere at all."
"I have a second home across the waterway from pinkney island refuge, so that may skew my answers..."
"I have been extremely disappointed in the water quality on my visits. Some of those with us have swam during our visits, but i have usually just put my feet in. I am not sure what can be done about the issue, but it looks very unhealthy."
"I have been going to the great meadows refuge in concord, ma for decades! It is wonderful - i love it there. I see more and more people though not paying attention to guidelines. I saw people fishing near the river and sometimes see people biking. Ifthere was just one staff member there on weekends during the busiest seasons, it would be helpful to remind people of the guidelines. It would also be great to just greet people. The last time i was there, was the first time i felt unsafe when a man passed me 2 times and was coming back a third time on part of the trail where there were no people. I quickly reversed and went in the direction of others 1/4 mile away though. If there had been someone there to tell, i would felt a little better. The trimming done in the spring along the trails was horrible. Some type of cutting machine trimmed growth along the trail very harshly, at a height of 2 feet or so. It did not suit the care that a federal wildlife refuge should show for flora and for the trails. Their is a rare milk parsley plant along the trails that i'm sure was affected. I saw it growing back later, but rare plants should be cared for, not hacked off. Please control the lotus so that waterfowl will come back! You will get more visitors if you can show the number of species coming back again as it used to be! One more thing - if this refuge needs money, there could be a voluntary contribution box - i'd put $ in it! Thank you for this opportunity."
"I have been hunting the refuge for over 20 years. In that time there has been a tremendous decline in the amount of deer on the refuge. I would like to see more game warden presence. When i first began to hunt here i would see game wardens in the woodsand roads. This kept everyone honest. Now i hardly see a game warden in an entire week of hunting. I also wish they would go back to letting hunters harvest one buck and that's it. I still love the refuge but i feel there are ways to bring thedeer population back to what it once was."
"I have been visiting great meadows refuge for over thirty years; i love the place.unfortunately, for far too long one volunteer has been using this place as a private country club. The man should be replaced asap. Such beautiful public land should belong to all americans."
"I have been visiting scfsp since 1962. My family has been visiting for at least 30 years before. I have passed my love for this place on to my children and grandchildren. I am hopeful that in the coming years efforts will be made not to develop any further. Just maintain what we have!"
"I have been visiting this camp ground for over 10 years now"
"I have enjoyed this refuge for the last 22 years. We have enjoyed hiking and sight seeing. I greatly appreciate the opportunity this refuge provides for hunting. I'm an avid bow hunter and love the chance of being able to harvest an animal of my dreams ifdrawn in the lottery hunt. Thanks again for the opportunities the refuge allows."
"I have hunted this area for decades and i have never been asked for my opinion. Thanks for the opportunity to provide comments. Thanks to everyone associated with this survey and facility."
"I have live close to this refuge and count it a blessing for my community."
"I have no idea if you are doing a good job conserving wildlife at the refuge, so felt that the question was out of place or i should be able to say ""i don't know"" - how would i know that it was being well done? While it might look nice and i might see birds and animals, i can't judge accurately there are the right amount of species year to year or relative to each other. While the ecosystem might look healthy, there could be overpopulation (think canada geese).... And since this survey knows what property i visited, why does it ask questions that don't apply - like importance of the condition of the visitor center when there wasn't one. And while the refuge abuts a river - why are there filament pipes for fishing line when there are signs saying nofishing allowed? Found that confusing."
"I have two roommates, so overall income for my household is based on what i make and what i assume they make. This is much different than if i was a mother, married, with a child. This survey is waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy too long!"
"I have visited this refuge every year, two or more times a year, for the last 10 years. I have never had a bad experience, excepting for a occasional rude visitor. When staff is out and about, they have always been considerate of me and my activities.that is appreciated. Restrooms have always been clean and warm(wife really appreciates it). At times, when viewing or photographing wildlife, one will always wish for something at the refuge. But think things are managed pretty well. As a manager of such facilities, you cannot make every one happy. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion. Jim yett"
"I hope someday there is a nature trail along the tualatin river heading south from our neighborhood to the refuge. The refuge is a beautiful place! We would rather walk to it instead of having to drive."
"I hope taht this document will not be used to cut funding to this refuge! Go wildlife!!"
"I hope tere will be more venue shutles i.e.bicycles"
"I hope the united states air force will not be allowed to take over the desert national wildlife range."
"I hunt deer and fish and crab the refuge"
"I just wish there was some kind of security there for females who like to walk alone. I don't go to the refuge during the week or early on sat or sun because there's nobody there and i'm concerned about my safety."
"I know that there was no snorkeling (marine life observing/watching) or surfing at this refuge, and maybe not at any, but those were two major draws for the trip and were not included in the options."
"I lead meditation hikes and would consider this for a future hike for the group. I would seek to find a quieter path, without as much foot traffic. Not sure if that is available there as i walked what seemed to be the only path...toward the water and along the dike."
"I like it"
"I like the refuge the way it is. No improvements are needed."
"I like the simplicity of this refuge - i stumbled upon it on a bike ride, then only later figured out how i got there. We've been going regularly ever since. I don't know much about it, why it exists, or what purpose it serves, but that's fine. We enjoy learning from the birders who frequent it what to look for, but mostly we go for an excursion into nature, and hopefully to see a muskrat or turtle."
"I like this refuge because it does not have the feel of other refuges. Needs nothing."
"I like to bring photo groups to the okefenokee and other public lands. At times the regulations and permit requirements are overly burdensome. Just because we have cameras does not mean we can pay huge fees of meet requirements of big businesses."
"I live in portland, oregon. I drive up to seattle to visit family and for recreation a few times a year. I usually stop at nisqually refuge and walk and bird for an hour to break up the drive. If i lived closer i would go there more frequently and spend more time walking and birding and would canoe as well, and maybe go to some of the refuge programs. It's one of my favorite refuges in the northwest."
"I live near the canaan valley national wildlife refuge and do a lot of volunteer work there. It is wonderful place. I am there frequently and enjoy/appreciate all who work there. The refuge brings in many people both from the community and outside thearea. Our work with the schools is growing the next generation of nature lovers and protectors."
"I live next to this refuge so i use it primarily for taking my dog for walks, enjoying the wildlife, views and the peacefulness."
"I live on west coast. Not likely to be in area again, therefore not likely to visit again."
"I live right across the creek from middle island and run/walk my dogs there everyday. It would be more enjoyable if the paths and road were better maintained and mowed. Overall i love this island, feels like my backyard. Im very interested in volunteer opportunities on this island...Middle island"
"I lived in rhode island for over 20 years and i used to visit this refuge several times a year, in all seasons. I have moved from rhode island 13 years ago, but whenever i'm in the state, i try to get to sachuest for a walk around. I was sad to learn thatseals are no longer stopping by on their migrations."
"I love every plant, tree, animal, fish, insect, and waterway. I'm the enamored duck on the cover."
"I love going there"
"I love going to the heinz refuge to run and be with nature. All of the staff there are very friendly as are the other people using the refuge. They do a great job!"
"I love great meadows NWR; it is near my home and i have been visiting it for years. The refuge system is one of our great national treasures and i visit one in every place i travel."
"I love great meadows, it's close and at certain times of year it's absolutely stunning and at other times it drops down to just being beautiful. The observation tower and the newer deck that extends into the wetlands are both excellent and have and willkeep my coming back."
"I love having the open space of this (and other) wildlife refuges. Keep them natural and accessible!"
"I love john heinz national wildlife refuge. It is a beautiful park and i appreciate that it exists and hope it has a great future where more and more people know of it and visit it. Thank you."
"I love nisqually wr! I go as many times a week as i can. I feel safe to walk by myself, and everyone is very friendly. I go both for the opportunity to exercise (you can walk many miles), and also to observe and photograph wildlife, while feeling completely at ease. It's an incredibly beautiful place, and i see something different every time i go!! Please do not allow hunters and fisherman to come in. That would absolutely destroy the purpose and peacefulness of the refuge. The closure at the end of the boardwalk during hunting season already affects those of us who like to walk the entire trail system, and i would be very sad if we had to endure more closures in order to satisfy hunters."
"I love nisqually! The only thing i wish were different about it is that i would like it to be more quiet (people are loud :)) and that it were bigger! :)"
"I love our local refuge and visit quite regularly! I love that there is such a place close by to town where one can walk in nature and enjoy seeing wildlife. This is very important to my well-being."
"I love our urban refuge. It is a huge part of our quality of life. Its restoration has greatly contributed to our community improvement and quality of life. I also appreciate the ease of access to connect kids to nature."
"I love reading the weekly bird survey results posted online. Hard to opine on quality of wetlands because they're thriving but with invasives."
"I love sam d hamilton refuge and try to make it out there twice a week to enjoy the nature!"
"I love spending time at the refuge! It's a great place to bask in the beauty of the outdoors, be active, unwind, or just think. The staff has always been friendly, and there are plenty of great trails for walking. My main complaint is that trail maintenance occasionally falls behind: enough that i have been afraid i had lost the trail a couple times."
"I love that these nature preserves are funded in our country. I've never seen a bald eagle in my life. That day i saw 12.     Thanks"
"I love the bike trail near my house, two blocks down. I try to visit every day if i can. I share my love for nature with my husband & daughter. It's so beautiful, tranquil and truely a lovely place. I try to visit for at least 15 minutes each day. Just sit and listen to classical music debussy always evokes nature for me. Thanks for letting me do this survey."
"I love the billy frank jr refuge. It's an amazing community asset and i am so grateful to the hard work that goes in to maintaining it."
"I love the billy frank jr. Nisqually wildlife refuge. It is a treasure to have this special place close to my home. It is one of the few places to bring friends and family to experience nature on many levels."
"I love the cache river NWR. I feel the staff are doing a good job. I just wish they were easier to get a hold of."
"I love the center! Hidden treasure"
"I love the educational experience offered to (chosen) school children, where they go to the refuge for their daily education every morning during the school year. I hope and pray that this program will continue to be funded. What a great experience for kids to be chosen to be educated this way!"
"I love the national wildlife refuge system. One of the things i like about it is that it provides access to undeveloped wildlife habitat, meaning not much infrastructure - a loop drive and a map is all i need. Thank you!"
"I love the nisqually NWR. It will be even better when there are exhibits and trails that tie in with the historical connection to the medicine creek treaty. When i commuted to work between tacoma and olympia, i probably stopped there once in 30 years,although i would occasionally drive just to the refuge. Now that i'm retired, i frequently stop there when traveling between tacoma and olympia. There is a different mindset when commuting."
"I love the ottawa refuge. Everyone there is very hospitable particularly during bird week. I love the auto tour and am glad that it was open more often this year. I am a larger person so the bus is not comfortable for me. I would love to visit the cedar point refuge but use my own car. Why couldn't we follow the bus or could you have more tours and allow one person per seat? I wish there was a restroom or two on the auto tour. There is definitely a shortage of restrooms in the area. The visitor center isbeautiful and always clean and well maintained. The refuge is 90 miles from my home - i would love to be able to volunteer...Maybe when i retire. Thank you."
"I love the raw beauty of the delaware beaches and have purchased a pass so i can see them all ,very excited ,and i love that you offer discounts for those who have less money it makes it affordable ,thank you ,keep up the great work"
"I love the sam d. Hamilton noxubee national wildlife refuge. I visit at least once a month, mostly to walk around and be outdoors."
"I love the warbler vista and balcones canyonlands hiking trails. I use both year round, almost every week. Thank you!"
"I love the wildlife sanctuary in concord, ma and take all my out of town visitors there. Thank you maintaining this beautiful preserve."
"I love this place for a time to feel away from the city even if i can still hear and see the highway - would be great if there was a shuttle from the entrance at 84th to the other entrance in ridley creek/ rt420. so you could park at one and walk all theway through."
"I love this refuge and have been coming here for about 20 years because it is within walking distance (about 1.5 miles) from my home, and quite beautiful! It used to be the best-kept secret, with its minimum signage, fewer people, etc. Recently, however,i have noticed (sadly) that there is more human debris - plastic bottles, cigarette butts - littered about. I've also seen bicycle riders on the trails. I don't know if they have missed or ignored the ""no bicycles"" signs. Thank goodness no pets are allowed! I can't imagine the hoards of dogs and ""poop"" bags that would be found there ruining the environment. Thank you!"
"I love this refuge and have been visiting and enjoying it for over 30 years. It's a meeting place for friends that come from various locations including the coast and locally in olympia. I hope it isn't over developed with man-made features, but kept inas much of a natural wildlife state as possible. I hope one day the hunting on the refuge is eliminated. It's very upsetting to go to watch wildlife, already stressed due to human impact, only to hear it being slaughtered during hunting season."
"I love this refuge and the fact that the local community is so birder friendly. I love seeing the birds, but even more, i feel a part of something when i come here."
"I love this refuge and usually visit at least two times each month, sometimes more. It is so wonderful to see such a variety of people enjoying this wonderful refuge. The only things that i would change about the refuge is to add a portable potty at thebeginning of the boardwalk over the estuary and to allow guided walks into some of the closed spaces of the refuge a few times a year. This refuge is well maintained and loved by many."
"I love this refuge and visit very often. For several years, i was there every day year-round. There are more and more people coming, and more human intervention in using herbicides, mowing and interfering with wildflowers and wildlife. It was much more enjoyable when they let it be natural."
"I love this refuge because it's not too crowded and it's well taken care of."
"I love this refuge! Many avenues to explore! Not well known to the locals. I especially enjoy visiting in the spring when the desert is in bloom. (Sorry this took so long - i was out of town)"
"I love this refuge."
"I love this refuge."
"I love this refuge. I am excited about the expansion of the wetlands that is underway. My only negative is, i would prefer to not have people running or jogging on the trails, as i feel it disrupts the birds."
"I love this urban wildlife refuge - the diversity of species, the neighborliness of the staff and visitors, the unique location in a major metropolitan area, and the mission it serves to support wildlife and conserve open space. Heinz is a gem."
"I love to go there the refuge is a beautiful place"
"I love visiting hNWR. It provides healing and recovery from time spent with my mom who suffers from a degenerative neurological condition. If i ever find time, i'd like to blog about the continually changing faces of hNWR. Ironically, i grew up just a fewmiles from hNWR yet only discovered it on christmas day 2017. I had visited once before in spring 2015, hoping my mom would enjoy the visit. I knew she had volunteered there briefly after my father passed away. Since christmas, i have visited almost 30 times and will be doing some volunteer gardening and butterfly photography there. I'm constantly telling friends to visit this gem!"
"I love visiting wildlife refuges. I appreciate that we have so many and most are amazing places to visit!"
"I moved to california in july therefore will not be returning thank you for the amazing photos and memories before i left."
"I moved to this area 8 years ago specifically to be close to crab orchard wildlife refuge. I am grateful that i can enjoy it almost daily. It is the best kept secret in illinois, and every visit, which is often 3 times a week, delightfully surprises mewith wildlife and new experiences. Thank you for maintaining the refuge. I still frequently go to the visitors center to meet other like-minded retirees, and buy from the giftshop, especially during holiday season."
"I normally visit this refuge several times a year. I usually hike and watch wildlife, primarily birds but also other wetland dependent species. This refuge is very accommodating to a variety of interests and means of transportation including cars, bikes, and watercraft such as canoes and kayaks."
"I only came because it was included on our tour of kauai, but did enjoy the visit especially all the different birds flying around and the beautiful vistas of the ocean."
"I only came in order to deer hunt. I will not be back until i am able to hunt again which will likely not be for three years based on the draw."
"I participate in clean up on the blue ridge parkway. It is volunteer work. It would be nice if you had a sign stating that if you want you can take a trash bag and help clean up some trash. pinkney island did not have much trash but there was some thatneeded to be removed. I will do it anyway but maybe some other people could do it also. most of the trash was on the far end close to the waterways and beach area"
"I pay federal taxes. I do not like to be double taxed to go into my federal lands pay entrance fee to enter"
"I plan to go back next year with my grandchildren, ages 5 and 11. We will crab on some of these visits. Prime hook is a very special place for me and other family members"
"I preferred the trail as it was for many years. This trail seemed too much like a wide hard surface path. I understand that this is necessary for people with disabilities though navigating the hill at the end must still be challenging and the beach doesnot lend itself to wheelchairs, etc."
"I primarily come here because it is a nice place to walk my dog. The trail is clear and i know about how long it will take. The only real challenge i face is that if i come alone, i feel like i can't go in the visitor's center because i have my dog withme, and it's a really nice visitor's center. More trashcans would be helpful to throw away poop bags."
"I primarily use the trails in this refuge for trail running only. The trails are nice but some are blocked off to access and i wish they were open and maintained. Also, some of the trails have limited parking and no restroom facilities at the trailhead. There is a reputation for crime (car break ins) at some areas. The parking at some trail heads is very meager."
"I really do not like deer hunting to be allowed within the refuge."
"I really do not recall seeing road access to other parts of the refuge other than to the boat dock and the visitor center. If they are missing, it might be an asset to build a road with observation points along the way. I learned nothing about the largeareas of brush and palmeto and how the environment seems to be so stable.. I will do some reading on the okefenokee."
"I really enjoy the chance to get away and be in nature"
"I really enjoy this refuge for bird watching, walking, running, and biking. I would like to see this refuge provide more education programs or volunteer opportunities for the local community (especially youth), specifically clean up projects and habitat restoration. I also would like to see more educational posters/signs around the refuge, especially about the negative effects of outdoor cats on wild bird populations. This is a big issue in this refuge."
"I really enjoy visiting the refuge park. It is very relaxing and tranquil. Thank you,"
"I really enjoy visiting the refuge. I just recently moved to the area and the refuge gives me the space to enjoy the outdoors in a clean environment. I would definitely recommend it to other nature lovers."
"I really enjoyed my visit. If it was a nicer day when i did visit, i would have spent more time here. It's very far from my home. If i lived closer, i would probably visit very often."
"I really enjoyed our brief visit. We stopped briefly on our way to another destination. During our short visit we saw bald eagles, osprey eating a fish, an endangered delmarva fox squirrel, and lady slipper orchids! Great visit. The only negative wasthat we didn't think to bring mosquito spray and got all bitten up."
"I really like this refuge. I wish there were opportunities to expand the boundaries of the protected land."
"I really question the amount and timing of all the prescribed burns done on the refuge. I use the refuge for bird watcdhing and they did several burns fairly late this spring. In fact several days before the last burn i observed a eastern towhee carryingnesting material in the burn area. I also bird at a state wildlife refuge where they do far less burning, and there are still many great birds there. Also, do we need to have so many oak savannahs? Just because we had them one hundred years ago, doesn't mean we need them everywhere today. Even the former ones would have been changed by now. Sometimes there is just to much ""managing""."
"I received notice in the mail that i did not complete this survey. I completed it a few weeks ago."
"I recognize the emphasis on the NWR visited but would welcome similar evaluation for other such NWRs visited. My wife and i frequent: ding darling NWR, sanibel island, fl bombayhook & prime hook NWR's in de, etc. Parks are virtually the only places whereone can safely see and experience most wildlife. Do we get to see the results of this survey?"
"I spend at least 2 mornings a week at the great meadows refuge. Each day is a new adventure with new opportunities. The openess of the area lends itself to fantastic photo opportunities."
"I stopped the survey as there were too many questions! Sorry! Need to make it more concise."
"I think a bike rental opportunity would work there because of the long walk on the gravel road. Also, i think a battery powered tram would be a good idea for future use in the refuge. It would allow those with handicaps to enjoy more of what those without handicaps enjoy. A ramped observation tower at the first pond would allow one to take better photos and allow children or those individuals with handicaps to have a better view of the nesting birds. Sometime in the future a welcome center/teaching center with restrooms and a gift shop might work well. The gift shop could sell nature photos and books, t-shirts and caps with the refuge logo. Also, a vending machine that sold water and gatoraide type drinks might be added only to be consumed in certain areas where there are recycle containers. I'm not certain what was past the 2nd pond area, but the refuge lends itself as a teaching/learning area to get groups like the scouts or young children involved in nature and teach them to help wildlife andnot to harm it. The refuge should not become too people friendly, as it may endanger the wildlife and the refuge itself."
"I think i have provided most comments within the survey however it would be great to see other refuges with such facilities as dwnr. I visit many refuges while on business in the usa and my family when holidaying in the usa too. We visit such locations toview wildlife and the kids get so much out of the visitor centres and information provided. Keep up the good work and extend the network of great facilities!"
"I think that this hunting opportunity is great and should continue and expand to more areas of access of hunting locations. I felt very safe hunting the two days i hunted and will continue to use this refuge to access, for hunting and whatever services come available."
"I think wildlife refuges are very important and like to see my tax dollars used to support them. Keep them public, not private they should be used to protect wildlife and for responsible recreation. Thank you!"
"I thoroughly enjoy my visits to the refuge. I visit often and purchased an annual pass. It is my happy place."
"I thoroughly enjoy this refuge on a regular basis. I think the experience could be improved by making volunteer opportunities easier to find."
"I thought i would send this in on the heels of the previous survey which i had recently marked. You had recently sent me this copy as a reminder. As my wife & i were pulling into heinx refuge for an evening walk in a light rain it seems a group of young people, probably older teens of driving age, had decided to have a racous gathering. Probably 18-20 in number utilizing a pavilion for their good time. They actually had the parking lot road partially blocked. We had no choice but make a u turn and leave.we don;t know if we'll be returning and have talked to others who feel the same. Some kind ov supervisory security is desperately needed in the evenings. Its a shame, heinz was once such a special place!"
"I thought there would be all kinds of animals at the refuge since it is a refuge and not just fowls."
"I thought this refuge did a very good job of balancing improvements i appreciate (restroom facilities, blinds, and parking) with the natural environment which is paramount. A few more signs at parking areas and on trail that correspond to refuge maps would be great. This is a wonderful refuge and for my purposes, i hope that resources are available to ensure its continued protection."
"I thought this survey was going to be about the area that is sectioned off on second beach in middletown, ri. and how you could do a better job about protecting the endangered birds. I live at the campground all summer and sit by the roped off area an observe all the people all day long . Some people read the sign and ignore the warning all together. Some don't read the sign at all. Some parents tell their children that the birds and the area are 'protected ' and then go in and play ball or frisbee. One lady said that you could go in the area, just not on the rocks where the nests are. When i tell them that it is against the law, they look very puzzled. Some people use the rope for a volleyball net. Many are on the rocks collecting sea shells. There should be better signage and the entire area should have a rope around it. There should be a sign on every pole! Many people are ignorant and think that the rules don't apply to them. I collect sea glass and would like nothing morethan to go on those rocks looking for it, but, i don't and follow the rules!"
"I thought this survey was supposed to be about the experience at the park not race."
"I took a walk on the beach and was asked by a very nice intern to complete this survey. I am an environmental lawyer and a huge supporter of all parks. However, i am ver disturbed by the paper, time and resources devoted to this survy. Whoever is in charge of this program needs to seriously reconsider its goals and investments. This is the third paper package i have received via snail mail. This is 2018 and there are electronic efficient and paperless options readily available. Whoever is in charge of this project should be ashamed of the carbon footprint and misallocation of scarce resources. Please do better!"
"I tried to do this on-line but could not access the site w/the information provided."
"I tried to do this survey online, but the link would always give me a warning message of an unsafe site, so i did not use it."
"I truly appreciate the staff opening the refuge to dove hunters. This was my second year dove hunting at the refuge and i am extremely proud to be able to utilize our public lands."
"I try to walk every day and this is my favorite place to go. It is on my way home from work so it is convenient for me to stop and walk the trails. I enjoy photographing nature and this is a great place to do so. Not a lot of people, which i prefer. Imoved to this more suburban area two years ago from a small logging town in the mountains. The refuge seems more like 'home' to me."
"I use the st. Marys boat ramp frequently, which is not on the refuge."
"I use this refuge now primarily for walking and enjoying the birds and wildlife. When we had young children we enjoyed going here with them and teaching them about the environment. They still like to go here when they are in the area. It is a special place for our family."
"I used a guidbook to find the trail. The art was what i came for. It was poor and uninformative. The mileage sign to other cities was the only interesting thing. I would not recommend or return."
"I used to be a volunteer there and really enjoyed it. It's a great site."
"I value our parks and the opportunities to preserve nature, habitat, and wildlife."
"I visit crab orchard natl wildlife refuge many times a year for fishing, hunting, hiking, and pleasure boating. I am very satisfied with the refuge and it's staff and appreciate the good job they do and the fact that we have such a wonderful place (the refuge) to participate in so many outdoor activities. I hunt and fish on public land, and crab orchard natl wildlife refuge is my number one choice of areas to do almost all of my outdoor activities. Thanks and keep up the good work- it is appreciated."
"I visit great meadows as a primary place to walk and enjoy the outdoors. I find it to be well maintained and lovely to visit in all four seasons of the year. At prime times, the parking lot fills up and cars have to park on the street leading to the parkentrance. At the same time, this limited parking probably prevents the refuge from over usage and preserves the peacefulness of the place. Great meadows is a beautiful, contemplative environment that is enjoyed by people of all ages. I have found it tobe a special place and would like to see it preserved much the way it is. If it could be made more accessible for people with special needs, this would be a wonderful enhancement."
"I visit noxubee often and throughout the year. Staff is awesome and they really work hard (and are successful) in maintaining a high quality refuge. I love to work on botanical knowledge and take my daughter to spend time in nature. I generally prefer less infrastructure and more ""wild"" areas of the refuge. One place that could be better maintained is the trail in the wilderness area. It is very easy to lose your way, since the trail is washed out and the few remaining directional signs are hard to see.overall, fantastic place that greatly improves the quality of life in the region."
"I visit this refuge once per week and it is usually the highlight of my week."
"I visit this refuge several times a month. The facilities are very good; i wouldn't change a thing."
"I visited pinckney island national wildlife refuge over thanksgiving weekend, while visiting my boyfriend's parents in bluffton. Pinckney is such a lovely place, and i've been encouraging them to check it out!! If you're interested in attracting new visitors, i'd suggest targeting the neighborhood associations in sun city to organize field trips -- especially for those who don't typically consider themselves to be nature-oriented."
"I visited the refuge with my toddler because he was getting restless on a car ride from sandusky to toledo. I remembered the visitor center had a small childrens area and place he could play for a few minutes. If it had been a nicer day we would have played outside."
"I visited the trail off rt. 90. i live on the edge of the vast marsh that comprises most of the refuge. that is mainly where i go, fishing. my comments are mostly reflective of walking down the gravel trail, not fishing in the vast marsh."
"I visited this refuge just for trail running. I would like to see more and better defined trails."
"I want more people in new orleans to know about the refuge. Advertise to the city!!!"
"I want to acknowledge all of the work done at john heinz to engage local, underrepresented youth and to get them out in nature. While not programs i participate in, they are so important to the people in philly. Also, unlike lots of other refuges, it isn't one you really drive around in, so lots of the transportation questions aren't too applicable. But, this place is my oasis in the city and i love it and realize how rare it is to have in such a large city."
"I was expecting more trails. From what i read online, i was expecting to be able to explore it more, but only a small fraction appeared to be open to the public. But then again it's a refugee, so i'm ok with leaving it to the wildlife."
"I was offended and felt the question that began with ""if people that look like me"" etc. was unnecessary and inappropriate. We are a mostly white family with biological children and adopted children that all look different and we love them all the same.why ask a question like that? This type of world view is what causes division in our country, states and communities. I was tempted to stop and delete this survey at that question, because i started wondering what you were after? Inclusive national wildlife refuges? If that's the case the government better start raising money for separate bathrooms, more bridges, more classes, prayer places, special foods, etc. because the demands will never end. We felt welcome as humans and enjoyed our picnic andvisit. Thank you."
"I was on a three hour valley gem river tour. We passed by the river route along the banks of the refuge. Employees were on board the boat to answer any questions we had. They asked us if i would do a survey and i answered yes. I have answered the questions that relate to my brush around the boundaries of the refuge but i did not set foot on the property. This my answered are rather few. However i support the concept of the refuge and am sure you are doing a commendable job in fulfilling its purpose."
"I was surprised by the amount of pollution in the darby creek. Thousands of tires, plastic of all kinds."
"I was the tour director on a tour bus group. We went on the sternwheeler tour boat that goes past this refuge in the middle of the ohio river. I have done this trip in the past but this is the first time we had fish & wildlife interns on the boat who gaveus a lot of information about this refuge. I never really knew about it and it was great to have them aboard to give us that info as well as answer questions about the area and the wildlife. Was an added bonus. We usually just get the local history and not the more in depth local wildlife information, especially about the refuge."
"I was there for a youth duck hunt. I was surprised to see others there walking the trials and bird watching. I have to drive from my home about 1 hour and 15 mins to get there. We now have a opportunity in the summer to stay nearby on the weekends. When this happens i will be visiting the refuge to walk and bird watch for myself."
"I was unable to access the survey online - i tried. We brought a picnic lunch to the refuge and were accosted by a volunteer - who said no food is allowed. I read all available rules and saw nothing - he was annoying at best. We never leave trash anywhere, last of all at our favorite refuge."
"I was visiting from europe and was impressed by the quality of this refuge which was near a big city. A lot of interesting birds. Keep up the good work!"
"I was visiting my son & daughter in law who live in a nearby town to the wildlife refuge. I very much appreciated the opportunity to spend time in nature with my grand kids. I am considering moving to the area to be closer to my son & family, and come seethis wildlife refuge as being some place we spend a lot of time, hiking the trails and learning more about the flora, fauna and lifecycles, seasons, etc."
"I went to magee marsh with the refuge as a planned stop, 1st trip was on weekend so drive was open. Then 2nd trip was a weekday wasn't aware the drive was (didn't research to see hours)"
"I went to this refuge solely for hiking. Reasons i may not return: no bathroom and no shade along the hike, and there are many other hiking options in my area."
"I will repeat what i wrote in the survey. Please consider making dogs welcome. Perhaps an introduction of dogs for limited hours, say,. 8-10am."
"I wish people wouldn't throw trash and that there would be an organized effort to pick up trash around the refuge."
"I would be nice if there was a box at the steigerwald refuge to pay to visit the refuge like there is at nisqually $5 and ridgefield $3. It's only a few dollars a visit and it could go to help pay for the upkeep of the refuge."
"I would just like to say i love visiting loess bluffs. It seems to me there are a lot of dead or dying trees, and often the refuge clears them by fire. I don't, however, see any evidence of replanting, and wonder why? During the last spring the burning of a largely dead woods removed many of the fallen logs that were used by raccoons, etc.. When most of the refuge was allowed to dry up last summer during road work/water management construction, there were many dead fish, frogs, and muskrats seeminglyeverywhere. many of the birds that depend on those food sources all but disapeared. I wondered if this was handled in the best way. Another suggestion: as many of the visitors seem to be single people driving the auto route for photography reasons, it would make sense to have the driving route be one-way counter-clockwise as it was last year for some time during construction/roadwork. That way, the wetlands would be on the driver's side of the car, making photography easier. The car serves as a natural blind, and getng out to approach the birds usually disturbs them. Overall, it's a great place to visit! Thanks for the opportunity to fill out this survey."
"I would like more please go fishing around or at there more stocking game fish would be nice"
"I would like to have a limited camping at least once a year. Hike or kayak in to a designated campsite."
"I would like to see bear hunting, especially with dogs banned."
"I would like to see check in boxes for hunting at all entrances to the refuge. I would like to see the antler size increase to state regulations for the area. I would like to access the connecting people with nature to gain access to hunting areas beyond the no hunt zone as long as all weapons were not loaded."
"I would like to see just a few more educational signs around the refuge that explain what you are looking at, i.e. Fresh water impoundant, salt marsh, tree types (species) etc. The brochure pamphlet is very good."
"I would like to see more bus tours on guided tours at other national parks - more driving tours - and literature of were to find parks that have them. I would go to them to find out more about the local wildlife well worth the trip. I just got back from charleston sc. Just to go to the national parks. I use the senior pass."
"I would like to see more hiking trails."
"I would like to see signs to identify birds, description of wetlands, streams in the area. History of the area (agriculture) (culture)."
"I would like to see the barbed-wire fencing removed from within this refuge. It is left-over from an earlier use as farm land, and is dangerous to wildlife."
"I would like to see the hiking trails improved and kept up. The quality of the trails has declined in the past few years, and they are in need of work."
"I would like to see trails that lead into the refuge from other areas. There have been discussions along these lines in the past for this area with interconnecting trails."
"I would like to thank hagerman for saving mother nature.."
"I would like to walk the roads in the winter as well as the summer"
"I would love to see the ability to access the refuge outside the normal hours increased. I'm a photographer and would like to be able to get into the refuge and get setup for photo taken when the light is most conducive to good pictures. This is typicallyan hour before sunrise and and hour after sunset. To be able to hike or bike into the refuge with this additional time would increase the time i would visit."
"I would love to see the nutria and other invasive species taken care of. It would be really good to see long tailed weasels. They've been seen in nearby areas but i have not seen any at this refuge. It would be good to have signs explaining ""why no dogson the refuge"" and ""why no bikes on the refuge"". The nearby metro (portland) regional parks nature parks have developed some really good signs that could be used for this."
"I would support the acquisition of additional lands for this refuge in order to make all parcels contiguous and to increase the size of the refuge."
"If possible more water areas neede during summer months to attract wildlife. Wetlands & water areas need more water in summer to attract wildlife."
"If theres a safe way to cut down on the number of mosquitoes on the trails, that would be great! Or maybe have mosquito nets you can wear on your head and face available for rent... Mor eorganized events would be nice. My kids and i love nature, and wouldparticipate in family-oriented events. This would include all of the seasons."
"If this is a refuge why are animals allowed to be killed? By definition shouldn't they be safe here?"
"If this refuge was within 3 miles of my home, i would go very often."
"If this was not accompanied by a postage free envelope i would not be returning. During my under grad years i volunteered at a wildlife refuge. The work you are doing is important. We need these ecosystems & habitats to be healthy & vibrant."
"If you wish to contact me for more specifics: sandra day daysl@comcast.net tele: 360.887.0881"
"In a couple of places, i accidentally marked a box and then marked the item to be irrelevant or a similar response. The response intended is the irrelevant or similar response."
"In june, there was not much wildlife activity when we visited. Better in january and february. Still, a nice place to go for a walk. Was told that some osprey had just gathered some fish, but we missed that. Saw some beavers a few years ago. Not thistime. I expect this location to get better as time goes on."
"In wildness is the preservation of the world."
"Incorporating the 'pond 20' property into this refuge, expanding native and natural habitats and educating the public including growing public access along the old levees would offer positive growth for the refuge."
"Increased access to viewing scopes would enhance our experience bird-watching. Some pull-off parking along the refuge roads would enhance our bird-watching experience."
"Increased signage and education on prevention of lyme disease important for out of town visitors with young children. The refuge is next to 2 town beaches and located near newport ri which is a travel destination."
"Intern phillip hunter and the kids summer camp in which he helped to organize has greatly increased my family's interest an attendance at our local ohio river island refuge in williamstown, wv. In addition to the summer camp we generally attend one of the educational walks that phillip puts on once a week as well."
"Invasive plants (reed canarygrass, himalayan blackberry, canada thistle, teasel in particular) are taking over much of the refuge. These invasives adversely affect the quality of the habitat. The fws seems to be doing nothing to try to control these invasives. It would be nice to have better access to other parts of the refuge, particularly the wetlands/lake closer to highway 14 with a viewing platform and photography blind that could be used in the winter."
"It's a beautiful place."
"It's a great place to walk. I wish there was a more defined trail/walkway on the way down from the refuge leaving. Walking from the beach to the refuge yiou have to walk in the road and there isn't much room to get over to avoid the cars."
"It's a very nice place just to go walk."
"It's a wonderful refuge that could really benefit from more funding."
"It's going to take more than putting up signs to save the wildlife."
"It is a family tradition to hike together through shiawassee flats. We are all interested in biology/ecology/environment."
"It is a great place"
"It is unsatisfying that hunters have more access to wildlife that non-hunters, specifically they have seasonal access to restricted areas that those of us who like to view and photograph wildlife (rather than kill wildlife). While i understand and, to acertain extent, support hunting as i have hunted in the past, why cannot we have the same access as hunters?"
"It seems that once steiigerwald lake trail was put in the lake has had major increase of algie and decrease in variety of birds. This trail is also used for walking dogs and would encourage that is is also purpose of trail system... only the frontage road of dike. I am concerned that no further trails increase which disallows dogs. This is consistent form of exercise for people with their dogs and far exceeds people who occasionally visit for birdwatching."
"It took almost as long to fill out the survey as the time we spent in this very small park. Perhaps there should be shorter surveys for the really little parks."
"It was a beautiful refuge. I enjoyed my visit."
"It was a good experience. I will be excited to visit when more waterfowl are at the peek. It was my first time just to check out the refuge. I'm glad it's here."
"It was a great day. The staff at the facility were very friendly and helpful. Very welcoming!"
"It was an extremely hot day with temps well into the 90s. I talked with a steward, names laurie, she was very nice and showed me some pictures of a doe and a fawn that she saw in the park. I traveled very slow and returned to my care once to eat lunch. Isaw great views of harriers, great blue herons and immature gadwells. This park has a great view of mount hood, with maryhill museum in the foreground. I marked two refuges and zero national/state parks. However, i have visited over 20 natural areas (cityparks, wetlands and reserves) through the backyard birdshop, which sponsors guided bird walks. Any questions, you can contact me joe blaumer 865-237-8371"
"It was very nice and provided information about wildlife for our kids as we were driving through the area."
"It was wonderful to bring our 3 dogs up to the hidden forest trail. Please continue to offer overnight backpacking and wildlife viewing opportunities for the residents in las vegas and surrounding areas. Please also educate/encourage visitors to pack outwhat they pack in and ""leave no trace"" so this land can remain available to both human visitors, and the wildlife that call this area home. Thank you for all that you do! We love having this refuge within an hour from our home!"
"It were great coming fishing, spending time with my grandchildren and husband."
"It would be helpful to get a weekly e-mail report on the wildlife activity and locations of specific wildlife locations in the refuge. Also reports on the conditions of the roads and crossings."
"It would be motivating if the results of this survey were available to respondents, perhaps on-line, but better if mailed. Describing what the refuge is going to do about the results would be a bonus and reinforce my support of the national wildlife refuges."
"It would be nice if the trails were maintained so when driveing you can see better brush is to tall weeds are to tall  maybe put more farm fields back in so we can see the deer aging"
"It would be nice if there were more benches for resting along the trail. The trail could be better maintained."
"It would be nice to have acess to more areas for nature photography?"
"It would really help to have the hiking trail maintained. Thank you so much!!!!"
"Its a nice place with great people working for it and great communities around it. ive loved growing up here and am hoping to be able to come back as much as possible for more hunting and fishing."
"Its been a big part of my life. I love the island, i hunted the idland when i was young! I bailed hay on the island for the ingraham family. My dad hauled cinders on the island to make the road better. I hunted arrowheads on the island when they would plow the fields. I fished there, and we would wash our car and our trucks."
"Just love this place, i used to golf here as a teen, now i walk the paths and marvel at the deer , turkeys, and tons of birds as an adult. Just let me know when you need a full time attendant, i work cheap!...Lol mlgilson@yahoo.com"
"Just love to see all the different birds and animals. A person never knows what you will see in the refuge."
"Just more patrolling and ticketing people parking in handicap spots that aren'tsupposed to."
"Just moved from tx and purchased home very close, heard about refuge through young neighbor and decided to take a drive to check out on a very lovely january day. Have traveled by rv over past year to many other states and have visited several wildlife refuges & national parks, when within close proximity of rv park. Not physically disabled, but due to age and asthma prefer not too much walking especially in hot/humid months! Love nature & wildlife! Will go again during other seasons to view the changes,now that we are residents and very close to our home."
"Just retired. This was a retirement/anniversary trip to hawaii for my wife and i."
"Just to clarify a couple questions in this survey: i was visiting family in the area we visited the refuge for about 3 hours - liked it so much we returned the next day for 4 hours"
"Just to say that i greatly appreciate this refuge. It has been an emotional lifeline for me in the past year or so. A tremendous gift !!!"
"Kauai was just beautiful. I loved the ruggedness and that it was uncrowded at this refuge and on the island."
"Keep funding our parks"
"Keep it as wild as possible."
"Keep or buy up natural spaces for our future generation"
"Keep protecting are wild life and i will do the same."
"Keep up the good work your doing great!!!!!!!"
"Keep up the good work!"
"Keep up the good work!"
"Keep up the good work! Connecting with the earth and its creatures is in our nature :-{)>"
"Keep up the good work!!!!!"
"Keep up the good work. We love it!"
"Keep up the great work"
"Keep up the great work at making things better. Appreciate the hard work and clean up after the typhoon."
"Keep up the great work protecting and enhancing our open lands for the benefit of wildlife."
"Keep up the great work! Long live nature! <3"
"Keep up the wonderful work! Thank you for being there....."
"Kilauea is beautiful and refreshing. The birds and the history of the lighthouse are unique. The addition of walking and hiking paths would be very appealing. Coves and terraces where one could sit and reflect would be appealing. Landscaping and water features could enhance the natural setting. Watching the birds is addictive, hypnotic. Imagining their perspective -- the air, the sea, the sun -- brings you back to experience it again. Interacting with nenes adds charm. It is soothing, restorative."
"Kirwin NWR is a remarkable place to enjoy wildlife and related activities!"
"Kirwin refuge is a good place to fish and its ok for hunting. However when the federal government put in all the restrictions for the area i believe it has declined as an animal refuge. I have been fishing and hunting at this lake for over 45 years. Itused to be called the goose capital of kansas with a hundred thousand geese or more. It would be nothing to go to the lake and see a field filled with 50 or more deer in it. I used to bow hunt on the south side of the lake and took my first deer there.now they don't plant the fields that fed the birds and deer anymore, they have cut down all the tress around the lake and your lucky to see a couple of deer when you are there. This refuge is hardly used do to all the restrictions that has been put on it. No camping, swimming, skiing, they have removed all but three bathrooms, block off most roads all winter. Our government with bigger and better ideas that just making things worse."
"Leave no trace"
"Let's try to get rid of invasive plant/tree species, non native plants, non native mammals. Let's replant native trees/plants. Let's keep trying to protect our endemic birds that are all on the verge of extinction!"
"Like the terrain at sulley's hill. Saw the buffalo heard, new cabins, prairie dogs, but missed the elk. Nice cover for the animals!"
"Like to have more areas like the magee boardwalk in my area with in 50 miles .. Hancock co. Ohio"
"Limit the number of visitors in the refuge during a given time. when they start parking by the maintenance building then there are too many"
"Living close to the sherburne national wildlife refuge for the last year has given us an opportunity to learn about national wildlife refuges and has opened a whole new weekend day trip and vacation stops for us."
"Loess bluff is near enough that i've been there 5 times in 5 weeks to watch eagles & other wildlife. The staff is nice & helpful. Road conditions are ok except rainy weather."
"Loess bluffs was the facility visited. Mainly went to view eagles."
"Looking forward to the changes at steigerwald over the next few year to enhance habitat and wildlife. Good birding area."
"Lots of good memories at this place."
"Love having places to interact with nature - everywhere i go."
"Love it, being able to drive out on the trails and take my pictures with no one bothering me!"
"Love loess bluff... Eagles... could use more pheasant..."
"Love love love the educational facility that nisqually offers to our schools. I've had so much fun learning and watching the kids when i accompany them on their field trips."
"Love ottawa! Saw map turtles on my visit!"
"Love that there is a place (this refuge) which serves as a real refuge from the worst of the urban environment which is so close and so awful. Although the highway and train tracks are visible from much of the trail it is not too hard to tune out the artificial noise and focus on the birds and insects. And even though you can watch planes taking off, angling up over the trees from the airport just steps away, you can also see the bald eagles soar high and the swallows dart over the water. It is a precious space."
"Love that you are working in this space - happy to participate in a small way if it helps better manage our parklands and refuges. Good luck with everything! It's a big country, and lots of different uses for the land/competing interests!"
"Love the isolation in my birding and exercising at loxahatchee opposed to the winter crowds in other local wetlands."
"Love the lookout."
"Love the oNWR an auto tour trail open during the work week that gets back into the refuge would be a nice improvement. Currently only the monthly or bi-monthly auto tour is available. Sometimes the best things are seen in rain or drizzly days but there is no opportunity to stay dry unless in your car. I have often wished the eastern stone road along the canal area would have days that the gate was opened and a small parking area near the lake. It's quite a hike all the way to the end, and a small parking area or turn around would be a nice addition for those not capable of the long trek. Walking long distances at this spacious refuge is fine for some, but not all of us are into hiking, hiking, and more hiking. I realize the impact a lot of cars would have on the wildlife but a few days a month would be a nice addition to have access to these areas...perhaps for members only and a pass or gate card could be utilized to get to otherwise inaccessible (walk to) only areas."
"Love the park!"
"Love the pinckney is. Nwr. Rules are fair and we believe it helps people to see nature w/o motorized vehicles around. A quiet and very clean environment. We would not miss it on our trips to the hilton head area."
"Love the place!"
"Love the refuge! Staff always friendly and kind. Wish there were summer opportunities for youth ages 10-13."
"Love the spit!!!!"
"Love the tinicum refuge!!!"
"Love the trails!"
"Love this place for its history and wildlife. Thank you for helping preserve it."
"Love this place! It is such a treasure to have in our area."
"Love this refuge and living by it. Thanks for all you do"
"Love this refuge and the kayaking opportunities, wish i had more time to view. The mangrove trail is beautiful and plentiful with birds on our day of viewing. Will definitely visit again and have already shared my time with others that frequent the area, but have not taken advantage of this great area/resource."
"Love this refuge as it has open views, good hiking trails, birds and it is not mobbed/crowded at any time."
"Love visiting nisqually NWR!!! It's my happy place."
"Love visiting the park every sat/sun and especially during the winter when we can observe pheasants, seals on the rocks, snowy white owl, falcon, eagles, hawks, deer in many stages of their lifes and more tranquil-not many visit during below 0 temperatures so we feel like we have the park to ourselves. love it! Appreciate all do for us by being there that we will drop off homemade healthy zucchini muffins and holidays cookies in the winter. wish they could offer water-we carry our own, but with litter things are not able to be done there."
"Loved having breakfast with the birds ""at the refuge."" Would definetely attend a mushroom or mycology foray here. Thank you for doing this survey!"
"Loved it and will go back often as we plan on living in the area on a part-time basis."
"Loved our visit. I recommend to everyone i hear that is headed to hilton head. lovely visit. Easy paths which would also be wheelchair friendly as well."
"Loved steigerwald refuge. It was stunning! Keep it for the wildlife and not for the hunters or fisherman. They have plenty of other places to go. A refuge should be a place wildlife doesn't have to worry about getting shot by hunters. Thank you formaking places like this for us to enjoy."
"Loved the staff they were friendly, engaging and busy."
"Loved to be there!"
"Lowest number of predatory birds and waterfowl that i have seen on this refuge in january, ever!"
"Lucked into tour of light house only 1 day per week. More days should be available since tours must be small in numbere and demand appeared great"
"Mailed first survey 3 weeks ago. Mailing this survey on 11/16/18"
"Main entrance of refuge emaculate well taken care of other entrance (420) prospect park not at all taken care of overgrown roads (access to refuse vehicles) roads rutted some a foot deep benches that are there covered by weeds couldn't sit if you wanted.deck not maintained over grown with weeds after it was installed forgotten about the refuge only cares about front around visitors center and installing signs that's it nothing for other entrance (420)"
"Make your survey shorter"
"Make your survey smaller"
"Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after. - hdt"
"Many tend to want a drive up accessibility to many of our beautiful places, but there is a cost for easy access. I have been all around our np, blm, nm and otherplaces. Many have become so over crowded that they are no longer those places that one gets toconnect with on a personal level. Nature is many places are more like manicured gardens rather than natural habitats. Cell towers, mcdonalds, wified drive by waterfalls make our beautiful county look like frontier land at disney. Not to sound cliche, don't take the wild out of wildlife. The journey for many americans make the destinations a far more meaningful trip. Most of us don't want a hilton, olive garden & rental jeep. We wish to camp in garden & tent, cook over an open fire & drive our own."
"Maybe i've missed it, but i'd like to know a) more about water regulation at the refuge and what the intended effects are of lowering the water level in the summer. b) what steps, if any, the refuge management is taking to curb the ""invasion"" of swans and geese. c) what use, if any, refuge managers make of all the data from ebird on sightings through the years. It seems like an impressive database."
"Me and my wife have 7 kids 2, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 17 and we really enjoy going out to the refuge and riding around and watching all the birds and other wildlife. With so many kiddos its nice to be able to go and do stuff together and not cost an arm and aleg. Beside they all like watching the birds too!! It's a fun time for them and they're always talking about it. Thanks for all you do. P.s. Thanks for #21 go cowboys."
"Me gusta mucho visitar el refugio,solo falta banios publicos gracias."
"Met our expectations for first trip and we will be returning in the fall."
"More & larger signage at strategic locations explain that this is a wildlife refuge and not a park. No dogs, bikes or jogging!!! More enforcement and monitoring"
"More boat ramps in working condition at kirwin national wildlife refuge would be great."
"More effort on restocking lakes & quality of fishing more food crops left for wildlife if not flooded fish in lakes declines"
"More game warden enforcement. I hunt these basins weekly and see people breaking game laws weekly. I call in but nothing is ever done. I watched a federal game warden drive right past people standing on the gravel road with loaded shotguns blocking for pheasant hunters at johnsons wpa and he did not even stop. There is very little enforcement presence. I see people driving across the basins, bypassing barricades, etc. please more enforcement."
"More open trails towards the north together with some comfortable benches"
"More potty stops on the auto tour. Please!!!!!"
"More restrooms and wider trail roads for both joggers and cyclists..."
"Moree trails"
"Most of my concerns are with the fishing access to this lake (kirwin res.). My older friends have decreased their participation on this lake because of the lack of handicap access. I can see this in my future and don't like it. This is the most poorlymaintained public access lake i have seen in any of the central states. The bathrooms i have no complaints about. The road maintenance workers have not had much in the way of formal equipment training. That is obvious. The boat ramps are a joke. Thedocks are minimal. Someone got the crazy idea to cut down all the trees. I hope that wasn't for the benefit of the pheasants which are not indigenous. We used to be able to hear the din of the nesting birds in town. Nothing now. I love the fishing in this lake when the lake level is up and still fish here when it's down. I have property in town and enjoy the people here. (I actually live in wyoming. It's a family property thing.) I am not likely to stop coming here anytime soon but that doesn'tmean that some of these deficiencies don't drive me nuts. Thank you for your efforts on the publics behalf."
"My children & i greatly enjoyed the kids fishing clinic. I hope we can attend it again next summer. Thank you!"
"My comment should be for cache river access at rock roe. I have not visited the visitor center at cotton plant and my comments should by no means reflect on the visitor center. There are two locations to extend a canal to rock roe, ramp under roadway bridge or at boat ramp located at rock roe. Each location serves on each bank of rock roe."
"My daughter and i visited this refuge as part of a vacation in which we explored the state of nd. She resides in co and i in ma. We enjoy nature and regularly visit national parks, refuges, state parks, etc. We found sully's hill to be a very enjoyableexperience and if we ever get back to nd i'm sure it will be on our list of sites to revisit."
"My family and i have a house within 10 miles of the refuge which we use for vacation and it is not our primary residence so we visit the house maybe twice a year with varying members of the family. I have been coming to kauai for over 30 years and visit this refuge quite a bit to show guests and family and extended family the views and birds and the various changes that this refuge has gone through!"
"My family and i love visiting the sunset deck. There is usually not very many folks there which it quiet and peaceful. I do wish there was information on the website that shows when balcones canyonlands is open and closed. We drove out there and the gatewas closed one day, there was no sign stating why and nothing on the website that we could find. We did find out you are able to visit the headquarters. Wish this information was put out more for public knowledge. Overall love balcones but communication with the public is lacking."
"My family has been visiting the ridgefield wildlife refuge for the past 25 years since we moved to this area. It is a great place to take visiting friends and relatives to enjoy either a drive through or hike or both. Always see lots of interesting birds, deer, nutria, or other wildlife."
"My family has enjoyed this park for years. Hiking, biking, canoeing for the most part. Love the observation tower. Guided boat tours were enjoyable, as well."
"My family is happy to have such an accessible place to experience and learn about nature so close to where we live."
"My girlfriend and i were driving further north. She was in a hurry to get there, but talked here into a brief stop (she was concerned if bridge was safe). I assured her it was. Could be detrimental if individual was not familiar with area. I have been toisland several times and bridge does not concern me. Think others more concerned because they cannot see end to end w/curve...Nor that other vehicles are on the island. Sorry, i could not be more helpful. I am moving into a new phase of life & with back surgeries more physical limitations. Will be nice to drive to island & have greater views!"
"My guest and i both enjoyed our visit to the billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge!"
"My husband and i enjoy visiting the refuge, 'our neighborhood park.' It's great for fresh, natural air, exposure to wildlife and beautiful scenery, and well maintained, and also an important place to get much needed exercise. These kinds of places are becoming fewer so the refuge is a sacred and special, well, refuge from an otherwise hectic life. We hope you don't offer more activities that will degrade the natural environment. Thank you for allowing me to comment."
"My husband and i enjoyed our visit. It also helped that it was in hawaii! Thanks!"
"My husband and i enjoyed the refuge very much. Any chance of seeing these birds and other wildlife closer up? If the volunteers could point out which birds are flying overhead, that would make our visit more enjoyable. This is very important to us, we were guessing a lot."
"My husband and i give this refuge an a+."
"My husband and i love visiting the refuge, observing the birds around the visitor center, taking a hike, and talking to the volunteers and people at the desk. We were so thrilled to see two eagles flying overhead. The visitor center is wonderful. It isso welcoming, clean, and educational. The woman at the front desk was knowledgeable, nice and answered a lot of our questions. The gift shop is also very nice.."
"My husband and i were traveling cross country from pennsylvania. We were staying in las vegas. We do not plan a return trip."
"My husband just retired this june. Our income will be lower in the future but birding will be a primary activity. We live about 3 hours from nisqually NWR."
"My mom and i were driving from maine to california and we stopped to rest from the drive and enjoy whatever was there at the refugee. Thanks for all that you do. Dean wilkinson - water resources 805-628-6221 www.floodlimits.com"
"My only comment is that i have seen a refuge turn into a place where you could only drive through. And now they have bluegrass fisted and charge money to cross a public bridge, way to roads used. Ridgefield wildlife refuge. I was a volunteer photographerfor there but way to many people!"
"My only issue with this park is the availability of the auto tour otherwise this is a very well run/maintained refuge."
"My only suggestion would be to mention that the ohio state university will be the return address on the survey. I am sure i recycled my first survey simply due to the fact that i wasn't expecting to receive anything from this university."
"My primary reaseon to go to crab orchard wildlife refuge is to photograph wildlife. I plan to enter pictures in the annual photography contest there this year. While there are other places i also go to photograph wildlife closer to me crab orchard wildlife refuge is the one i enjoy going to the most."
"My respect for this refuge (ding darling NWR) fell sharply last year when the refuge management chose to degrade a longstanding habitat for resident birds. That habitat was an important nesting site for black-necked stilts, and it also provided a safe haven for species such as wilson's snipe. Based on some novel reasoning about a local population of rats (specifically, the so-called sanibel rice rat, which might or might not be a distinct subspecies of the common rice rat and which might or might not benefit from the conversion of the pre-existing pond and island into a small amount of additional cordgrass marshland), the refuge destroyed much of the pond and all of the island, added at least seven concrete culverts, removed a small wooden pedestrian bridge, and closed one path. They did all this without inviting any significant public input until they had already committed to going ahead with the habitat destruction. It was a very frustrating and disappointing episode for many of us in the local community."
"My son enjoyed the partnership with the refuge raising blandings turtles in the classroom. I love this refuge. We visit the lamar valley in yellowstone every year, too."
"My son loved the activities for kids this summer!! The weekly safaris and the week long camp were both fantastic!! We would definitely come back for educational fun activities!! We have not gotten back since school and sports have started but definitely agreat place for us in the summer! Will try to get back for some weekend activities this school year."
"My view is that these environments are best served by remaining undisturbed by human influence, albeit there exists a need for protecting select species. My suggestion is to find ways of educating without disturbing."
"My visits to hagerman NWR have increased since i retired. I sold my house and moved in order to be closer to this refuge. I enjoy visiting, volunteering, and learning there."
"My wife and enjoy visiting the refuge, sometimes we visit twice a day especially during january and febuary when we look for the bald eagles. We live close by so that makes it easier to visit. We enjoy crappie fishing and we're disappointed that the fishing hasn't been as good the last 3 years. Hopefully something could be done to improve the fishing. We also missed going to the eagle/waterfowl tour they hold each january, for some reason they didn't have one this year. Thank you for providing a beautiful place to visit and enjoy nature."
"My wife and i are very excited to have the opportunity to kayak throughout the shiawassee national wildlife refuge on the cass river. What a great time we have had already! Thank you for your service."
"My wife and i live near the refuge and enjoy visiting all year long. Spring and early summer we like to fish and also look for wildlife, especially bald eagles. During the winter our main purpose for visiting is to view the wildlife which there is a variety to view. The crappie fishing has declined in recent years, last year was the worst, i guess it's due to the asian carp problem. We missed having the eagle/waterfowl tour this year. That was always a great family outing! Thank you for maintaining the refuge and allowing us to visit and enjoy the great outdoors. R. Rhyne"
"My wife and i specifically traveled from out of state to balcones canyonlands national wildlife rufuge to see the endangered golden-cheeked warbler and the black-capped vireo."
"My wife and i were on a 28 day road trip from virginia to the badlands in south dakota. We visited twenty-two federal sites -- parks, monuments, battlefields, etc., and 12 various state sites. Our visit to the sully hill national game preserve was unplanned. We saw a sign (road sign), checked the map, and paid a visit. It was a pleasant surprise. We spent approximately four hours at the reserve. Fyi, for our 28 days we spent jus under $6,000 or approximately $215/day. That includes hotels (prefer hamptoninns), food, and gas -- we drive a hybrid. If the preserve was in our backyard, we would probably be more motivated to actually participate. Hope this helps."
"My wife is native american. We go to fort totten day's every year with our son's family. Our grandkids keep up the great work. Sorry i'm a little late."
"Myself and dozens of other people highly dis-like the refuge being logged. With the funds gained from logging the refuge, where has this money going to? The roads have not improved, there are no additional parking areas, the sides of the roads have not been mowed and multiple trails are limited to foot traffic. At one point of time you could drive an atv down them. I would like to see them opened back up."
"N/a"
"National & state, wildlife refuges need to be sufficiently funded in open to restore habitat for wildlife and provide free visitor educational experiences. Starviab public lands and nature programs is bad policy and short term thinking. Current leadershipat doi is hell-bent on giving away public resources to special interests including industry, cattlemen and hunters. These policies diminish the lands, wildlife and resources that need to be protected and restored for future generations. More exhibits about climate change and restoration potential are important, as are volunteer opportunities that provide education and that help the land recover are essential."
"National wildlife refuges and parks like pinckney island are such important places for both conservation and education. We value the opportunity to visit and hope the federal government continues to fully fund and provide the resources necessary to maintain and preserve these special places. I hope your survey reveals the full extent to which people use and care for our wild spaces. If you need to follow up in any way please feel free to contact me at dunmiret@fultonschools.org."
"Need more benches to rest on"
"Need more bike paths and add washrooms. Don't want it too touristy or built up."
"Need more focussing on things for the fish and fishing and less on ducks!!"
"Need to cut brush for better ocean view"
"Need to do a better job of maintaining water levels in the wetland areas.there is to much variation of water level that hinders use of area and attraction of migratory waterfowl.at one point of the season the area was mostly drained and unusable and thenwith a couple of weeks it was at flood level.if they monitored the level better the levels would not fluctuate so much.this seems to have a pretty direct affect on how much migratory waterfowl use the area.i have been hunting the area for over 30 years and have seen a wide range on how well this is monitored. For the most part i think the area is a great resource and the staff does a good job of providing a quality outing"
"Need to do something about the erosion of the bank at ""sandy point"". In 20 plus years i have seen the bank erode, causing the loss of trees, picnic tables and a great amount of land loss."
"Nisqually delta, my brother lives in lacey, washington and each time i come up i like to visit the wildlife refuge. Over several trips i have seen a mink, bald eagle, native frog, and lizards, sea gulls, squirrels, ducks, etc. I come from los angeles union station by amtrak to lacey. I saw the shadow of the bald eagle pass over me. It was 6-7 feet wide. I looked up and had never been that close to one before. The black berries were coming into season and i ate a few on the trail. Thousands of berries werenot ripe yet. I hope the animals get most of them. The catterpillars with big webs on the trees were a concern of mine. Are there any natural preditors? Would it help to just rip the webbing and catterpillars of instead if using pesticides? My brother is80 and i am 72 so we did not make it all the way to puget sound. We could hear the invasive bull frogs croking."
"Nisqually is a great amenity for the community and environment."
"Nisqually is an absolute treasure, an ecological asset to our puget sound community and a model of how various governmental agencies can cooperate to create a mircle. Nisqually would not exist if our navtive american tribes, local county, state agencies and the u.s. Government had not sat down together - each giving a bit - so that the last remaining estuary delta could be preserved and expanded. The result is a unique venue - wild, open and full of life - completely assessible to millions of people. Thechallenge, as always, will be balancing the community's love with the preservation of the resource. P.s. Kudos to the artist who created the ""wildlife loving the refuge""!"
"No return envelope provided."
"No smoking or a national refuge policy would be nice!"
"Nope"
"Not advertised locally only came across this refuge by word of mouth . Dismayed to find no one to guide or help. Only saw two other visitors in two hours. The printed guide was good."
"Not one person welcomed us or even acknowledged us, until we were leaving and a guy asked us if we'd do a survey. Since we are full timers, workamping, our mail sometimes doesn't reach us for a month or so. So, that is why it took so long to fill out thesurvey."
"Nwrs are a national jewel."
"Nwrs need more support. I would be willing as a non-hunter to try to pick up some of the slack from declining hunting revenue. The government shutdown is a travesty, and i would support more protections for all the people who work at NWRs."
"Okefenokee is awesome! Protect it!"
"On behalf of my family and i, thank you for creating a wonderful environment through your staff and recreational areas of the park and thank you for keeping the okefenokee swamp clean, beautiful and safe for the indigenous species of animals there. God bless you."
"On the way back from the refuge a large black bear crossed the road in front of us. On the nature trail i was on was surrounded by wild blue berries, i could not help but think, what if i encountered the bear while hiking. It was two hourse before i saw another human."
"Once again i'd like to say thanks and stay awesome!!! P.s. Those interns that headed out to wildlife areas nationwide clearly got the bet summer job ever :) i hope their future careers take them to even more interesting places doing equally importantwork"
"One large group of 20 plus hunters from holdrege, ne hunts for pheasants opening weekend. This group takes over and diminishes the hunting opportunity of other groups."
"One of my favorite places to visit."
"One of my favorite places to visit. Thank you for all the care and consideration that has been shared to make this a refuge for all."
"One of our favorite NWR's. It would be helpful if grasses along banks of streams and marshes were kept at a height that allowed for unblocked or at least less blocked viewing."
"One of the best places i have camped and kayaked."
"One symbol speaks loud to us all."
"Only comment would be that a sign could be posted as to the total mileage from beginning out to the lighthouse and to put up mile markers so people know how far they have gone or still have to go. Other than that it is beautiful."
"Only having the option of male or female is outdated. The survey should at the very least have the option of neither and opt not to reply. Non-binary option would be optimal."
"Only that i am grateful that our wildlife refuges exist and i fully support funding and maintaining them."
"Open up small game hunting areas near the east side access of refuge.."
"Ottawa is a great NWR, but given its size more consistent access to all areas by car would greatly enhance the experience."
"Our family loves going to bayou lacombe to crab. The scenery is beautiful and everyone is friendly. We enjoy and relax every trip. Thank!!"
"Our family loves the thualatin wildlife refuge. Waht a treat to have it in our neighborhood!"
"Our reason/goal for visiting the kilauea lighthouse was for observing the scenery and wildlife, and being able to photograph same. (We were spending a week as typical tourists, staying in the princeville area.) The lighthouse/refuge location presented a comfortable, easily-accessed location for doing what we came for (once we figured out to proceed through the outer gate to the main parking location). We found the location quite attractive, and my wife very much enjoyed the photographic opportunities withthe local bird varieties. I was unaware before visiting that the area serves as a wildlife refuge, but am gratified to learn that it is. I have made a number of fairly ambitious & extended forays into wilderness areas (mountainous, backpacking-accessibleonly, strenuous climbing, etc.), and very much enjoy being in ""natural"" areas, particularly if they are visually and/or historically notable. Given that, i must say that our reason for visiting the lighthouse and its environment had little to do with therefuge status of the place, a status we learned of only after being at the site."
"Our sons grew up in camden county nearby. Unlike their peers, the preferred the swamp over the beach. Now we take our grandkids and other relatives when they visit and keep an annual parking pass because we still enjoy going even when it is just my husband and i enjoying a quiet hike and picnic. The okeefenokee is a beautiful, magical and primitive place that calls you back!"
"Over all a great experience looking forward to next year and bringing both of my son's. Also looking forward to applying for the controlled hunt opportunities at the refuge."
"Over the years we have seen it grow and become a well known spot for the citizens in the area of kansas, nebraska and missouri. I do not know how many other states but i am sure a registration place for visitors may be of importance, although i have noidea how other folks feel about this idea.........Or if their is another way to ascertain the visitors origin.....Happy new year"
"Overall , i am proud of the noxubee wildlife refuge. I live about 6 miles from the refuge; i occasionally participate in programs or volunteer, but mostly i exercise and enjoy the outdoor activities on at least a weekly basis. Would like to see the trails maintained just a little bit better and the speed limit enforced."
"Overall we enjoyed our time but our biggest complaint is that the trails were not well marked and the parking lot was not well marked. The trail was washed out and it would have been nice to have signage along the trail so we would have known where we were at during the hike and where the end of the trail ended."
"Paddle boat rentals would be awesome"
"Peace and love, peace and love."
"Per the web page, the visitor's center is not open on saturdays, sundays and mondays. I don't think this is a good idea. Most families visit on week-ends or monday holidays. I wonder if the little latrine at the refuge is locked on these days too? My2 visits to the refuge have been during the government shutdown. This refuge is in the middle of nowhere, so there should be a place to use a restroom 7 days a week. I travel 12 miles on a rural road full of potholes from the nearest ""place"" on a highway to get to the refuge, so being able to use a restroom at the refuge is of utmost importance to me."
"Perfect place to practice/run 5k. I run at john heinz 2-4 times a week."
"Person who welcomed us and asked us to do survey was our only contact and he was great! He was not a local but was very enthusiastic."
"Pickney island. Don't ever change it! One of the most gorgeous pristine barrier islands around a national treasure!"
"Pleasant visit always, well kept"
"Please consider more developed walking paths"
"Please continue to keep this refuge for are future generations, to be able to see and enjoy the wildlife experiences. Thanks"
"Please do more to involve the local, multi-ethnic community. Reach out to local schools (academy park high school & k-center & 4 1-8 schools in se delco school district) i love this refuge!"
"Please do not loosen regulations on hunting and fishing within the refuge. Steigerwald lake is a wildlife refuge and it is the only wildlife refuge in the area. Fishing is allowed on every other local body of water and there are plenty of opportunities for hunting nearby."
"Please don't encourage bicyclists to bike on the roads"
"Please don't let the air force take over more of our refuge here in las vegas."
"Please get rid of the asian carp...the carp will stop people from using the refuge"
"Please get us access to fishing area"
"Please keep it wild. Between farming and development, south florida has no land left for wildlife. Lox needs to stay wild to support what little wildlife is left."
"Please keep the hunting slection program under refuge control"
"Please keep the NWR system healthy. We need nature to help us stay sane in such a violent world. We must also give wildlife good habitat to help protect them from urban sprawl. We need more of these wonderful places. Thank you for caring enough to getour input. Regards,"
"Please keep the refuge itself as unspoiled and undeveloped as possible. If infrastructure must be added, add it to the entrance or park area so that the experience of being in a wild place can be preserved. Thank you"
"Please maintain the trails to the best of your ability or to the extent resources allow. Also, please safeguard the refuge for people who simply want to enjoy it for its peace and tranquility and natural beauty. Thank you."
"Please open the wildlife drive earlier in the spring and later in the fall. Also more shorebird habitat would be great."
"Please put up signs at the steigerwald NWR specifically prohibiting drones! These signs are visible at other local NWR properties. Drones are an occasional problem at this refuge!"
"Please send a sticker: carley rhoads, po box 2085 mississippi state, ms 39762"
"Please send more if i can help w/the environment gwen baker 730 lake top way roswell ga 30076"
"Please thank the volunteers that asked us to do the survey. They were friendly, engaged, knowledgeable and the reason why i agreed to do it. We had a wonderful time at the refuge and will be back next year"
"Please write your congressional representative and senators to vote against the air force's efforts to permenantly take of 3/4 of the desert national wildlife refuge so they can expand bombing ranges and the nevada test and training range. Please also contact the offices of senators catherine cortez masto and dean heller (possibly jacky rosen depending on the mid-terms) and demand that they tell the air force ""#dontbombthebighorn"". Seriously, the air force is likely going to get their way. Please help!!!"
"Posted trail maps at the trailhead would have been helpful even though i had gps/map downloaded on my phone. It's nice to know the options that lay ahead. I loved it, so beautiful and peaceful. A great find on my first trip to kauai!"
"Prefer caucasion instead of white when asked my color"
"Preserving areas such as these are extremely important. We have enjoyed these areas all across the country."
"Public hearings before plans are implemented ! So many times over the years bad decisions have been made over at great meadows in concord regarding various situations. Millions of dollars have been wasted ! More notification and public participation inthese decisions are necessary. It's not the 1970's anymore, stop wasting our money on half baked schemes and foolishness."
"Public hunting and fishing areas in kansas are limited. This area is not managed to enhance either activity. It seems that it's use is discouraged due to elimination of camping and recreational boating as well as wildlife habitat. Most restroom facilities have been eliminated."
"Purchased ti;me-share on kauai in 1980. On my many trips, this is always one that i visit."
"Quality land based blinds for goose hunting should be maintained!"
"Really enjoyed all the bald eagles we were able to see from the driving tour through the refuge. Will definitely return in the future."
"Really enjoyed our visit, just wish we had had more time than we did"
"Rebecca young, michael schramm and terry ___________ are extremely friendly, engaging and helpful with any questions or concerns. Thanks to the staff, too, for allowing the west virginia master naturalist program to use the palatial visitor center facility for meetings and education programs!"
"Refer to previous comment"
"Refuge's like this are very important for conservation in general and specific in this case for birds and desert bighorn sheep."
"Refuge - balcones canyonlands national wildlife refuge this is a very important refuge because of the preservation the golden cheeked warbler and black capped vireo. I believe you are doing a good job and it is important that you keep it up. Expansion of this refuge would be very good."
"Refuge has a problem with too many lotus water lilies."
"Refuge is great. Wonderful trails and wildlife close to town. Very enjoyable hiking."
"Refuge is in great shape and is easy to go and visit for me. I enjoy it."
"Refuge is very nice and is well run----volunteer staffing is excellent----(personally and observing)----air conditioned----very clean (building & bathrooms&trails)----parking area is fine ---a nice place to visit and to bring our visitors----in fact we are proud to bring visitors there or refer them--only wish is extended open hours for restrooms----birders/hikers are there early in am and later in evenings"
"Refuge is: low key, under the radar, close to many, no parking stress, pristine, a gift/blessing"
"Refuge managesr should control or even eliminate the population of nutria which is an invasive species and degrades the natural envvironment."
"Refuge was fine. this questionaire is way too long. I wanted to help, but gave up"
"Refuge was very well maintained and visitors center was informative. Staff was helpful."
"Refuse to finish due to the nature & content of your questions. This does not help your refuge in any way that i can determine from your questions."
"Reopen old trails that are closed and/or build new ones, do not pave any trails as hard surfaces hurt feet, keep refuge open later at night to allow some night use such as owl watching/listening, stop allowing noisy weed whackers during refuge hours, emphasize birdwatching and other wildlife observation and hiking/trails, do not allow hunting or bicycling, take out playground, install more benches, emphasize wildlife/birds/wetlands/nature over education and field trips. Later has been allowed to takeover refuge too much, interfering with nature and more passive uses of the refuge such as walking to see birds. This refuge was a gem a decade ago but efforts to restore it for salmon have ruined it and we doubt those efforts have worked. It has less land accessible to the public now. We see far fewer birds than before and the experience is much more crowded and less aesthetic and enjoyable now."
"Resolve ongoing issues with usaf over boundaries and use of this land! Make back country experience more accessible."
"Ri park department is doing a great job in environmental management. Including management of trails and clean up. The facility is always clean. I am 73 years old and i walk the trails ever day."
"Ridgefield wlr is one of my favorite places to visit. I tak my time observing birds & wildlife. Keep record of all that i see. It is a very relaxing getaway for me!"
"Ritidian beach is gorgeous. A blessing for the community. I heard that the us military will be taking over the area within a few years and i think that is awful."
"Ritidian point is one of my most favorite beaches on island. It's well preserved and not crowded. I would go here every single day if i could. As soon as i hit the entrance from the main gate...all weight on my shoulders disappear. If i was younger, i would have loved to be part of the staff that works to keep the wildlife and historical sites safe. I truely love nature and i am so thankful that ritidian is protected. I am blessed to be able to enjoy the area as often as i do. About 8 years ago my husband and i were fishing out at the reef and a tourist got pulled out over the reef. She freaked out and i knew that she was close to drowning. I'm a good swimmer but have never been trained to save someone. I've seen how to but was so scared that she would panic and drown me. I turned to shore and waved my arms screaming for help...two locals that were snorkeling in shore made their way out to us and the two of them together swam out to bring her in. She was exhausted and couldn't speak english...but i could see in her eyes how scared she was. No matter what signs there are, no matter what they're told, there's always that one person and just doesn't think! People come here and see the beautiful ocean, but don't realize that we are all just visitors to it. We have to respect mother nature. Sorry, went a bit off course there... ;-)"
"Sachuest point is a treasure! My only concern is the sport fishermen who access the water from the area. That is the only reason i feel unsafe walking the trails alone. Otherwise, the area is used by families and people of all ages."
"Sachuest point is a treasured area on aquidneck island. I can imagine having my ashes spread there some day."
"Sachuest point wildlife refuge is a beautiful place - please keep on doing what is being done! I would like to visit the other refuges in ri, also."
"Sachuset wildlife refuge in middletown, ri is a true treasure. It is well maintained, offers stunning photography opportunities, and the people are nice. This is a well kept secret to rhode islanders based on the fact there never seems to be alot of people there."
"Safety is main concern when stopping to use restroom. Would like to use trail but not comfortable. Did it once with group, loved it but have not used it since."
"Saw a good variety of wildlife on this first visit. Looking forward to returning to explore more and find more."
"Section 1 #11 - i wrote in this section, and it might not have been clear because i squeezed it in a small space, but the primary reason i live in the refuge area - i live across the street - is because the refuge is here. I sometimes literally role out of bed and go right to the refuge, let me correct that, i could role out of bed & go right to the refuge - about three years ago i lived about 3 miles from the refuge, and i was fighting anxiety, so i did at that time role out of bed, pack my breakfas, ride my bike to the refuge, eat my breakfast at the refuge while watching the hawks catch fish, then ridge my bike home, 12 miles total on the daily bike trip. I did this everyday because at that time i was retired. Oh and many times i would buy lunch on theway home."
"Section 4 #36 it is hard to answer this. We have a time share week and always plan a trip to pinkney island. Hard to say how much costs would have to increase before i stop coming. Unfortunately age would be the deciding factor in the long run. We love pinckney island and the varied wildlife mainly birds and alligators. We hope this place is maintained for generations to come."
"See my comment about opportunities at the refuge. Some changes need to take place with the rest areas. They way its done now is hurting hunting. Feel free to reach out if anyone wants to discuss that further."
"See photos. This is why we walk @ steigerwald!!"
"See section 5, comments on question 2."
"Sherburne national wildlife refuge is a great community asset! Please keep wildlife drive open in the winter."
"Shiawassee NWR is a gem in/near this urban area. The staff has always been professional. One concern is safety in parking areas. Years ago there was a murder in parking lot. Broken auto glass is occasional. Could be patrolled more often by staff. My family & self always have a wonderful time! Thanks!"
"Shiawassee NWR recently updated its hunt plan and expanded hunting opportunities. Expanded waterfowl hunting opportunities were my exclusive reason for visiting the refuge this year. While i'm very pleased that they've expanded these opportunities, i dobelieve that they could be further expanded with very little additional impact to the resource."
"Short but enjoyable visit."
"Since my husband has dialysis treatments 3 times a week and i drive him to the clinic, i began to realize that i can't sit beside him for the 4 hour treatment and i realized that the tualatin national wildlife refuge is just a mile or two from the clinic.we have been there before with a young grandson and enjoyed our visit so i began to go there 3 times a week and plan to walk for 1 hour. When i was a little girl we lived on a 400 acre grass seed ranch in the willamette valley and there was a stream and 40 acres of wetlands on the ranch. I tried to go and explore the wetlands every day. This refuge is similar in some ways and i can quickly shed the cares of today and enjoy the birdsong and the rustling in the grass and the ducks and geese and theeagles and even the nutria. I call my 3 hours a week at tualatin refuge to be my therapy."
"So glad to have found this nat'l wildlife refuge. A friend posted photos on instagram and facebook, which is how i found out about it. It was lovely, but would've been even better if there were a few more trail signs indicating which way to go when (andwhere the art walk was located). I'd've also appreciated a few more informational signs / interpretive panels showing what local flora and fauna i'd likely see (text & photos)."
"So lucky to have a refuge so close to home! I plan on visiting more often"
"So sad to see that the bridge to the island will be closed for 2 years. would like to see some method of pedestrian transportation maintained while the bridge repairs are done."
"Some answers i prefer not to comment on. I wish the visitor center were open more often and i wish there were more law enforcement ot patrol & keep property from being damages & destroyed. Also to enforce laws on littering. There are no trash recepticalson the refuge. When there is no where to put trash, peopl just throw it in the water or wherever they are. Plaes keep america beautiful!!"
"Some of the questions are dumb, but the i love the facility"
"Some refuges need prescribed burns. I think it would be useful to get input on how well people understand the need for these burns, find them acceptable or objectionable, or would like to learn more about them."
"Sometimes visitor center closes early, make it easier to get stickers"
"Sorry about my delay in participating in this survey!"
"Sorry i was not more help. We stumbled across this refuge on a trip to the area for other reasons, and wanted to pay a visit. We live across the country, so this visit was random."
"Sorry, but this survey has way too many questions."
"Spend day trips in april may early june birding ottawa crane creek, oak openings areas some fall trips spend 10 to 12 years on day trips"
"Spend less money and time messing up the natural habitat"
"Staff apparently wants to return the area to a more natural state, removing olives and other non-native plants. This is a bad idea. The non-native plants are part of the history of the site, having been put there more than a century ago. They are prime attractants for birds. Terrible mistakes have been made in the last few decades. The old pond, which was home to bullfrogs and other species, was replaced by the current cement pond, apparently to get rid of crawdads. That didn't work. The cement pond is anugly and mostly sterile addition that no one likes, though it is an excellent breeding spot for crawdads. We cannot believe that the stream was cut off from the giant cottonwood tree, causing it to die and recently to fall. The whole experience was shocking. We watched the tree die over many years, while staff did nothing. Most recently we waited for the pomegranates to ripen, which always attract all kinds of birds. Instead, this year most of the pomegranates suddenly disappeared, apparently harvested by staff or visitors. That was disappointing."
"Steady budget cuts to usfws have resulted in much less attention to this important suburban refuge, in particular years of neglected conservation work to limit the american lotus that has now completely overtaken both impoundments during summers. This hasgreatly limited use by many species (osprey, waders, migrant ducks) and completely diminished shorebird migration habitat. It appears loocal usfws has all but given up on the problem, rendering this refuge more a 3 season refuge."
"Steigerwald is a critical wetlands area important for migrating birds and salmon. I hope that we can restore this important habitat for the health of wildlife, to save money for local industry that are flooded every year, and most importantly for the health of communities that live along the columbia."
"Steigerwald is a very enjoyable place to visit"
"Steigerwald lake is a wonderful resource for birdwatchers and nature lovers in the portland/vancouver region. It's one of my favorite nature places in the area. I especially like the art and interpretive signage and the connection through the dike trail to the adjacent captain clark park/cottonwood beach. The free volunteer led birdwalks are a fantastic resource which i participate in as much as i can. I appreciate that this is a free resource but i know our NWRs need support, especially under the currentfederal administration, i would be willing to pay a fee to visit this NWR."
"Stop closing off road .stop closing of parking area.more fishing areas"
"Stop dragging/feeding waterfowl during state wide hunting season. Have a waterfowl hunting opportunities on management area."
"Stopped here on my way home from texas where we spent the winter birding at manyparks etc. This is a great place with many birds, if i'm in the area we would definetly stop."
"Such a great place and i think not many people outside of the concord, mass area know about this lotus experience come late july, early august. Over the years i would give a grade of c- in advertising all the great refuges that are available in local areas. This is how we foud out. My wife and daughter and i were canoeing down the concord river and just happed to stop for lunch at an open spce along the river. A family from china walked down to us to inspect our canoe and they told us about the beautifullotus back up the trail. This was in august 2017. and we returned in aug 2018 by car and foot to view the lotus."
"Such a great resource for everyone! All the people there were loving it!"
"Summary - fishing trip to kirwin reservoir. Factors other than the quality of the fishing were insignificant to our visit or our return."
"Survey a bit long - think of ways of consolidating questions? Make american green again"
"Survey is just too long! Rather spend my time fishing & hunting"
"Survey is too long."
"Survey is too long. Likely that many questions will be of limited value. Suggest testing survey and modifying to focus on most important items."
"Survey much too extensive! Why spend this much on a survey when a simple 5 min question period by a rep would have been more appropriate and less costly. Any survey this extensive usually is passed over."
"Survey too long"
"Survey was good but too long"
"Survey was to long have a great day steve"
"Survey was too long"
"Survey was too long, questions should be short and concise. Almost lost interest at the end of survey."
"Survey was too long. Your folks were actively surveying on the weekend that oregon state parks were free to the public. Likely affected your sample population so not sure what good your results will be for those dates in oregon ."
"Thank all of you for your continued efforts to keep our wildlife refuges so enjoyable to visitors, with the foremost focus being on the safety and preservation of the animals and environment. [name]"
"Thank for the opportunity to complete the survey."
"Thank you"
"Thank you"
"Thank you !"
"Thank you for all your hard work!!"
"Thank you for caring for this land!"
"Thank you for collecting this data to help the usfws to mangae national wildlife refuges."
"Thank you for conducting this important survey. I feel very committed to the dungeness national wildlife refuge as it is one of the premier places to visit in this area."
"Thank you for conducting this survey. I spend much of my free time and some of my professional time within refuges, parks and public access properties throughout the united states observing and photographing wildlife for educational purposes. I am a supporter of the fish and wildlife service and feel their service and function should not be diminished."
"Thank you for continuing to make the outdoors available to people who are not rich, not hunters, or/and not the powerful. It is important to keep these lands public and open to people who just want to enjoy nature and wildlife."
"Thank you for doing the survey. It didn't make me feel comfortable to answer with such a delay after visiting. I hope i remember well. Also, being sent so much paper doesn't match our values for sustainibility. We had a great time at the park. Met verynice and knowledgeable rangers."
"Thank you for having a nature refuge. We need more of them."
"Thank you for keeping the refuge open and accessible to locals/visitors. This is one of the most beautiful beaches on island. I hope that everyone who comes to visit appreciates and respects the place like my family and i have through the years. It's arare gem that we love to come and visit from time to time. We hope that in the near future that infrastructure will be of priority regarding roadways from main road to refuge, having restrooms, showers and trash bins available for visitors."
"Thank you for mailing the survey. I was unable to connect to the website."
"Thank you for maintaining this beautiful place and managing it for the benefit of the public."
"Thank you for monitoring our public lands. Without them i wouldn't have access to natural areas or the activities i enjoy in them. Their availability and upkeep contribute significantly to my quality of life."
"Thank you for preserving this beautiful refuge (shiawassee) for all to enjoy!"
"Thank you for providing this open space to our community. It encourages me to ""get out and walk"""
"Thank you for taking the time to analyze use and need for precious resources!"
"Thank you for taking the time to gather our feedback. I apologize for taking so long, and i suppose many of my peers either never get around to it either or rush the responses (or leave them blank). Keep it up."
"Thank you for taking the time to improve national wildlife refuges. They are a primary reason i travel and visit areas for recreation!"
"Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the survey. Your student volunteers who conducted the survey were extremely courteous, friendly, and helpful. They added to the quality of the refuge experience."
"Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this survey. I hope you will be able to do something that preserves and enhances the natural habitat for non human species, and increases awareness of the public re: the huge impact human activity is havingon the great extinctions occurring, and what we as people can do to improve that. I love this refuge and hope you personally have a chance to visit it. And oregon. Wishing you a long, happy and productive life in helping save our planet."
"Thank you for the opportunity to provide my feedback."
"Thank you for the opportunity to rate this facility. We traveled extensively this summer expressly to visit national parks from rocky mtn national park to shenadoah national park, voyageurs, teddy roosevelt southern unit and many others. We also stayedat many state parks and visited several wildlife refuges. We stopped at the facility in this survey while staying in las vegas, not knowing what to expect. The visitors center looks very new and is very nice. We had limited information from the internet and website, so did not know what to expect. We like the idea of wildlife viewing and hiking in less crowded areas like this facility (most national parks are overrun with visitors in the summer). As mentioned in the survey, a sign or two along 95 would be helpful, but otherwise access to the visitor's center is easy. A more helpful website or other internet content would be helpful for first time visitors. Thank you. Tim laflame"
"Thank you for the survery. Best of luck! Pinckney island is a wonderful place. Please do all you can to protect it."

"Thank you for the work you do!"
"Thank you for this wonderful refuge and see you soon!"
"Thank you for your active, constructive involvement in this wildlife refuge!"
"Thank you for your research! Good luck!"
"Thank you for your time to collect this data. I hope that for years to come our wildlife refuges will be cared for and available for all to enjoy."
"Thank you for your valuable research efforts! Please contact us with any further questions about our visit! Charmariemoreau@gmail.com"
"Thank you for your work! I value wildlife/wildlife habitat conservation. I would love to see beaver @ ridgefield NWR. I disagree with wildlife mgmt involving killing animals."
"Thank you i hope i was able to help."
"Thank you osu"
"Thank you to the staff and volunteers for keeping the john heinz national wildlife refuge beautiful. Please let the public know if we can help in being better stewards of wildlife habitats."
"Thank you us fish and wildlife service for providing the opportunities to use the park and enjoy nature, please keep the drive throughs open!"
"Thank you very much for your service. Definetly signs on trails there are zero marked trails. Hiking groups programs weekly."
"Thank you!"
"Thank you! More activities (outdoor) beyond hunting and fishing is appreciated."
"Thank you! Please protect our public lands. This is our national heritage."

"Thanks for asking my opinion and good luck with your project. Oh, and go blue! :)"
"Thanks for doing all that you do!"
"Thanks for doing this i hope it helps - barbara"
"Thanks for doing this survey and attempting to improve the experience."
"Thanks for everything ridgefield!"
"Thanks for maintaining and making available great meadows in concord"
"Thanks for our beautiful local refuges. Just would like restrooms/port a potties at pinckney and bring them back to savannah NWR"
"Thanks for protecting the beautiful dungeness spit and other wild and scenic areas.! Keep up the good work!"
"Thanks for providing a great space for nature to stay wild!"
"Thanks for running this important program. I recommend making the survey much shorter to get a higher number of responses :)"
"Thanks for the chance to comment. Our national preserves and refuuges are vital to this country. Keep them safe!"
"Thanks for the great time during hunting season, i understand that ya""ll were on government down"
"Thanks for the opportunity to participate in this survey. I hope it is helpful. P.s. I did almost toss it in recyicling before opening it since i couldn't imagine why i was getting mail from the university."
"Thanks to everyone (refuge, university collaborators). Hope the survey is productive."
"Thanks!"
"Thanks!"
"Thanks!"
"The access road to metzger marsh, crane creek and the observation road at ottawa wildlife refuge has been closed the last two or three visits. Please more access to these beautiful areas. Please reopen the beach at crane creek p.v.r."
"The annual birdfest and bluegrass hosted by the refuge and the friends of ridgefield national wildlife refuge is an excellent event that offers activities for different interests and does a good job welcoming a variety of people to the refuge and educating them about nature and the area's native cultural history."
"The arthur r marshall nat wildlife refuge needs no further development. There is a visitor center at the main entrance. There are boat ramps at the main entrance and at the south (lox rd) entrance. There is fishing and duck hunting. There is no need for expanded hunting for other than duck hunting. There is a need for great expenditures to attack the ""old world climbing vine"" that is growing out of control within the refuge."
"The best places on our island of guam besides not having access to the more refuge in military restricted land. I enjoy this peaceful secluded refuge outdoors to escape the stressful routines, control, and crowded places only for a moments day. For a day,two or even a weekend would be medicinal expereince and a safe one too! A designated refuge camp grounds for these outdoor activities would great and fun! Experienceing these moments through bicycle touring has educated me more about respect and preserving our natural resources and beauty today, tomorrow and for the future generations. Thank you :)"
"The black water refuge has good display of wildlife at the visitors center. New addition to building was a good thing. Volunteers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the center. I would recommend a visit to the center for everyone."
"The boat guide was extremely interesting and we enjoyed learnng about the refuge, the nature of the swamp and the history. Very knowledgeable!"
"The canaan valley wildlife refuge is managed for hunting, but hiking is either discouraged, or not allowed. I appreciate that cross country skiing is allowed, but i would like to see the refuge available to hikers all year - i understand that hiking canhave negative impacts on wildlife, ecosystems, etc., but those would be the same as hunting (which is simply hiking while carrying a gun, isn't it?)"
"The coordinators that had a table at the refuge were very friendly and helpful. They helped us navigate the park."
"The corn creek pond/water resources have been disasterously managed. A concrete pond was installed to help w/crayfish management, but at the cost of removing a lot of dense vegetation/wetland habitat. Now the habitat is gone, but the crayfish have not been removed. So what was the point of this management decision?? The trails are poorly managed. Fruit-bearing trees native & non-native hae been poorly managed. Maybe the refuge needs to engage the bird-watching community more when making these decisions? Something needs to change to keep this key demographic vising the refuge."
"The crappie fishing has been exceptional the past couple years. I do wish there were more opportunities for mushroom hunting also more opportunities for hunting."
"The deer hunt held at this refuge is a unique and special opportunity. I have applied for the hunt for approximately 14 years, and this is only the 2nd time i have been drawn in the lottery permit system. One additional activity that i would like to seebe made available to refuge visitors at hagerman is the ability to collect shed antlers. Currently refuge rules prohibit that activity. If that activity was allowed, i would visit this refuge at least two additional days each year and possibly more than that. I would suggest making it legal to collect shed antlers through a permit-based system. I would be willing to pay $50 each year for a permit to look for and collect shed antlers on the refuge."
"The experience of going to great meadows enhances the quality of my life in every way. Thank you!"
"The federal budget cuts and hiring freeze are making it hard to complete the refuges mission."
"The fishing was great and the wife and i had a good time! The fish cleaning station was fantastic!"
"The girls asking to take the survey were really nice. The people in the visitor center were nice. Everywhere i went in north dakota, people were welcoming and great to talk to."
"The grass and weeds aroung the speasway should be cut more than once a year. In the mid summer the grass & weeds get almost shoulder high seem as if they only cut it in the fall of the year. It should be cut mid or late summer. It need more than one cutper year."
"The hunt that was opened up is great. But i still fell we should not have to pay to trap and help maintain animal populations. I can't run a ton of traps and come even close to the numbers they want i work full time. And with only being able towalk around out there there's not a lot of time to do so. It would be nice if we could use utv's out there on the auto drive and for trapping staying on the roads with them. Also being able to use boats for trapping to. Thanks"
"The interpretive cd accompanying the tour is very well done and greatly adds to the experience."
"The junior refuge ranger day was outstanding at the dNWR! The work the fws did to make all the activities enjoyable for all generations was exemplary and must have taken a lot of time and effort. I must commend all the staff and volunteers that made this day ""one to remember!"""
"The lighthouse tour was very informative and enjoyable!"
"The lighthouse volunteer presenter was delightful and interesting."
"The limited draw of 40 archery permits helps to keep the hunt enjoyable, however the earn-a-buck (eab) requirement is not warranted when the lake level is so high and has flooded so much key deer habitat, because the number of deer using the refuge is waydown from 2015, as is evidenced by the decreased harvest since then. The eab requirement should be annually evaluated and based on biological reasons, not just a set-in-stone sociological reason. It is more than bothersome as well, that the neighbors that complained about high deer numbers on the refuge and crop damage, which lead to the implementation of eab, don't allow deer hunting (other than family) on their land. The refuge should follow a stated strategy of objective 1 of the visitor service goal in their ccp, which is to ""increase the archery-only deer hunting unit to include the solomon river bottom"". Doing this would increase the quality of the deer hunt, as well as increase the harvest."
"The link to complete this as provided in the letter ""go.osu.edu/nvd"" does not pull up this survey try it thank you"
"The loxahatchee national wildlife refuge is a real treasure. I am aware that discussions are underway to make some changes. While i am not a hunter, as long as allowing hunting does not impact my safety, i am okay with it. I think that anything that brings more people to the refuge is good...as long as they treat the refuge with respect."
"The man who asked me to do this survey was very polite and interesting"
"The national wildlife refuge system is essential to support species diversity in this country and species diversity is essential for the health of our planet. Over the many decades of my life, i have seen an increase in interest in the hobby of birding. It gives me nearly as much pleasure to see a beautiful bird as it does to see young people out with their binoculars and cameras in the refuges enjoying nature. I hope your survey shows how precious the refuges are to wildlife and to people as well."
"The noxubee refuge is wonderful and i enjoy my trip every time i go. The free canoe days are amazing!"
"The okefenokee national wildlife reserve is the highlight on my list of places to take visitors to. First visited the swamp before the fire in 2011-12. I was glad to see the homestead had been preserved and the pictures of the equipment/coverings kept onstand by for thge purpose. The boat trip to the prairie is outstanding, seeing all the gators, the shaking earth, something you have to see to really understand. I did take a wrong turn coming out of the refuge on my first visit. The signs could be better."
"The only hunts that should be allowed at the refuge should be related to invasive species only."
"The only issue i encounter while at the refuge is boaters not following the posted speed limit. People boating at high speeds tubing back and fourth on the river greatly take away from the fishing experience. The wake created by these activities can behazardous to kayaks/canoes/small boats."
"The only thing i did not like about the refuge was all of the oil pumping stations. These pumping stations seem incompatible with a refuge. I fear the birds being harmed."
"The onsite volunteers and guides (friends of ridgefield, audubon) were knowledgeable and added greatly to the enjoyment of our time in the refuge."
"The ottawa national wildlife refuge is a beautiful halfway point between metro detroit and cleveland. We enjoy the gift shop, the trails and especially the clean restrooms & friendly staff. We enjoy our lakes, rivers & wetlands in our area near detroit, mi, also. We always in our area near detroit, mi, also. We always get the annual state and metropark stickers so we can enjoy nature all year long"
"The place exceeded my expectations. I absolutely love this place! Thank you!"
"The problem wasn't the roads, it was the manner in which they were repaired. Washed out areas were treated with deep, loose gravel that is nearly impossible to manage with an automobile. There were signs indicating the need for a 4 wheel drive, but thatprecludes the vast majority of the population from ever seeing the interior of the park. Kind of stupid."
"The public lands of this country are very important to me and my family. It gives us a place to be in nature and escape the daily grind. We do not want these places to be destroyed by corporate interest and greed."
"The question about ""people who look like me are treated differently"" is a fantastic question. I'm glad you asked it!"
"The question in section 5 part 3 about ""people who look like me are treated differently"" is very inappropriate. Hard to know what is being implied. This was a very long survey. I would think that you could get the feedback you are looking for with a more concise survey."
"The questions seemd odd at times and more geared towards a national park like olympic rather thant dungeness."
"The refuge had a beautifully kept main trail. Thanks to whoever maintains it. And thanks for conducting this carefully conceived visitor survey."
"The refuge is a jewel of our community. Although i appreciate hunting i feel the most safe walking/exploring areas that are banned from hunting."
"The refuge is basically our rain forest in the usa. It is important to preserve this area for future generations to see and for the health of planet earth. The refuge needs to keep strick rules in place to continue to protect this environment and the animals that call this place home."
"The refuge perfectly straddled the line of making us feel welcome but protecting the natural world. We were visitors in another world and the creatures and water/plants/etc in that world were more important than us. As it should be. Initially we were afarid of the gators but mutual respect made the observation of gators safe and easy. Bird watching was awesome. More sunrise/sunset opportunities would be great. We were amazed that our misperceptions were dispelled. We expected heat, humidity, bugs, smell.instead, fresh air, fresh smell, almost no bugs. If you want more ""off season"" visitors, advertise that. I don't think you should grow your visitors base too much. If you start getting more drunk boaters/fishers or rowdy people who don't respect the wildlife, the refuge could be endangered."
"The refuge seems to be heavily impacted in terms of their ability to open and maintain canoeing trails within the refuge. I feel more dollars should be allocated for this purpose. I feel it is extremely important for the refuge to provide this level ofopportunity to the public."
"The refuge system along the columbia seems to favor hunters-sauvie island, ridgefield - and not wildlife or people. I guess this compromise, which limits access for non-hunters, is the best we can do w/ the wetland relics we have remaining. But i find itheart breaking that i can no longer walk quietly on the land, exploring and enjoying. I appreciate the work you are trying to do, but i need to move away from this over-crowded area - we cannot access the land at certain seasons, get out of our cars, etc.thank you for doing what you can - i used to eat wild fowl + game, and understand the pressures of hunters, but they get to walk and shoot + kill where i can't just walk, crazy!"
"The refuge was amazing and it is critical that we maintain and promote these natural resources across our country for the enjoyment of all our citizens."
"The refuge we visited was pinckney island NWR in sc. We visit every time we go. A restroom at this refuge would be very much appreciated. During alligator season, one does not want to go for a comfort break off the trail. Please consider providing this necessary provision. Thank you."
"The refuges are not just refuges for wildlife. They are refuges for people - refuges from stress and pressures that drive deterioration of our planet. Keep up the good work!"
"The ridgefield wildlife refuge is a wonderful local resource for me. I love bird and wildlife watching. The auto tour is pure genius. I have bird watched in many areas, only to have birds fly away as tourists noisily march down the trail. By keeping people in the car, i see an astonishing amount of wildlife, more than any other location. The roads are easy to travel, there are lots of turn offs, and the trails are kept clear. I appreciate the hard work of the staff and volunteers. Thanks so much!"
"The road into the refuge could be a little wider, the restroom could be better maintained, only during summer is there a need for more parking and finally clean fuel service vehicles. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have a national park pass and i am a senior and i wish i didn't have to fill out an envelope every time i entered the refuge."
"The shiawassee refuge is amazing for its beauty and natural while life."
"The staff at hagerman do a great job with what they have but they need more support from usfw not less."
"The staff at the plank house exhibit during bird fest were very friendly and informative about the native culture and the replicas of native tools and techniques were very interesting. Also, sandhill cranes rule! We saw over 20 on our visit!"
"The staff on site were so accommodating, so very nice, and very knowledgeable!"
"The state of louisiana is blessed with tremendous natural resources and bountiful wetlands. The people are pretty unaware of what they have. Poor education is the number one problem in this state. As diligent as the state and local stewards of our refuges are, litter and vandalism is a constant problem. I salute the employees of the u.s. Fish and wildlife and the louisiana wildlife and fisheries departments for their dedication and hard work."
"The survey instrument was way too long to keep my attention and unfortunately caused me to skip to the last pages of the latter sections so i could comment, like this. You are doing good work but the your clients probably don't have time for this extensive survey, especially in this day of misuse of information."
"The survey is not represetative to the refuge. I was using the boat ramp at st. Mary's, wv marina. Not refuge owned. Use the refuge, the island for no purpose. Survey should have been done on the island."
"The survey takers were very pleasant and i was happy to hear about this program. Good use of public resources to ensure that you are meeting the needs of the public."
"The survey was a little long. :-)"
"The survey was longer than expected. I stopped answering questions towards the end. we went to the refuge for a family walk and live nearby so many of the questions were too in depth. We drove from home, went for a walk in a new nature area and drove home. Sorry i didn't do a better job of answering your questions."
"The survey was quite long!"
"The survey was too long!!!!"
"The survey while i see why it is useful it is very long and most people are not going to take the time to finish it. You might send it out in sections or have your volunteers stationed throughout the park to fill out certain sections etc... Just a suggestion"
"The tennessee national wildlife refuge ( duck river unit) has allowed the deer population to be decimated on the refuge. The opportunities for deer observation and enjoyable hunting have been exponentially decreased over the last 15 years with the refuges deer management strategies. The deer used to be one of the main attractants to the refuge with multiple people driving to observe the numbers of deer as well as the large mature bucks the refuge would grow. Friends of mine from as far as 100 miles from here comment on how they would visit the refuge recently and were shocked that they would see zero deer now. This deer decimation program has also affected surrounding private areas and the local landowners from having more opportunities of deer harvest because the refuge hunters will have to first shoot a doe before harvesting a buck. The hunters have been allowed to use rifles in this flat land, which i really don't know how someone has not been shot accidently, and their hunting technique now is towalk the overgrown fields and ditches and jump deer and shoot at them on the run. This has led to many deer being wounded and left to die. They hunt this way to try and get their doe so they can concentrate on a buck. I don't know why though, becausethere are so few deer left there its not worth the efforts. When they first started allowing bow hunting, then muzzleloader only hunting, the tNWR was one of the premier hunting destinations in the state and people from all across the state would apply for the permits. Now it is looked at as a waste of time to even apply for. I understand the refuge is designed for waterfowl management, but it used to be so much more(better) for all opportunities and still held incredible waterfowl numbers. There alsoneeds to be well defined buffer zones installed around refuge lines where private houses are close to the property line. Refuge deer hunters will hunt right on the property line and shoot across onto private prope"
"The thurston cty hydrogeologist spoke about ground water supplies. With the change of climate our once wet rain forest are now dry. 4 mos/yr and water is an issue of concern. It was great that the nisqually NWR allowed this talk. Now talk about global warming, declinin clinork populations & orca populations could help people realize the severity of our situation. This administration is gaging scientist & trying to keep the public uninformed. Science needs to prevail."
"The tour group we used did a great job educating us about the local ecosystem & its vulnerabilitites. They are an asset to the area."
"The tour guide at the homestead was very helpful and informative."
"The two ladies that conducted the interview were very professional and knowledgeable. I enjoyed discussing the refuge with them. They seemed genuinely interested in what we had to say."
"The visit commented on in this survey was during the us government shut down, so staff and facilities were not available."
"The volunteer docent leading our guided tram tour was excellent. She told about how the locals harvest the crabs and make the crab soup. So when we went to beaufort the next day we ordered the crab soup at hemmingway's restaurant and it was wonderful. Shetook us on a walking tour around the pond & gave us binoculars so we could see the birds up close. One man had brought an expensive magnifying telescopes so we got to see a number of birds really well."
"The volunteers and/or staff at the visitor's center were courteous, helpful and very enthusiastic. The hummingbirds behind the center were enjoyable to watch and photograph."
"The volunteers who told me about the survey were very helpful, welcoming, enjoying, etc. Thanks"
"The volunteers(?) Who asked if i would be willing to participate in this survey were very professional and extremely knowledgeable about the refuge. Their knowledge improved our visit."
"The website did not work. It did not show up."
"The weekly bird census on the friends web page is closely watched by many birders and photographers, and generates a lot of spur-of-the-moment visits when unusual or vagrant species appear. It often includes animal sightings as well."
"The wildlife refuge in ridgefield, wa is an awesome place to spend a couple of hours at."
"The wildlife refuge is a real asset to the area. The staff and volunteers are courteous and knowledgeable. The facilities and grounds are excellent. It is great place to visit, relax, learn, and commune with nature. A big thank you to all who make the ohio river islands wildlife refuge possible."
"The wildlife refuge is an invaluable resource to us and i feel certain others who also enjoy visiting. We are very supportive of state and national parks and will instill that love of nature in our children."
"The worker at the refuge was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. My family and i enjoyed our brief visit."
"The young man justin who approached us about the survey was very nice and easy going with his conversation. We visit the refuge often because we all love the outdoors and the refuge is only 10 minutes away. The refuge provides many opportunities for people to learn more of the outdoors and the animals that are in the refuge. Every time we visit, we see something new. The staff are pleasant and helpful."
"The young people we spoke with at ridgefield were so nice. They were doing an excellent job. Keep these places protected so we can enjoy them."
"There are dozens of random trails across the hills due to the barren terrain and ease of walking anywhere. Efforts are being made to make a more formal switchback trail. I would possibly leave one main steep trail straight up the hill for workouts becausethey're going to run it anyway if they want a burn. (Zig zag railway ties maybe?) As mentioned before i would love to see a trailhead from the adjacent chula vista city park so people aren't peeing/making noise/throwing trash in the residential area of the existing entrance."
"There are some areas of refuge that are open to rifle hunting too close to residential areas. Though needs to be given to proximity of houses and not just wildlife management targets. Make these areas bow only or bow/shotgun/muzzleloader only. It seems like native brook trout are a forgotten species on the refuge. I would love to see habitat improvement projects for trout on the refuge. I wish fishing would be given the same emphasis as hunting on the refuge. There are very few places you can access to fish without going off trail and breaking the law. Engaging fisher people would be great opportunity to attract more visitors, volunteers and work on some trout habitat. It would be great to see the refuge work with individual landowners on foot access trails from neightborhoods to trailheads. This would cut down on people having to drive and increase usage. Also stop with the hidden cameras - it's a waste of taxpayer money and turns people off to the refuge."
"There has been many improvements at this refuge and hope they continue to improve the surroundings."
"There is a 12' alligator in ibis pond at pinckney. When there is no one around i feel very nervous about being near waters edge. I don't want to be the first statistic. Why can't they move this one to the savannah refuge? There is a flickr site dedicatedto pinckney refuge. I wish more people contributed photos to it and contributed to their daily sightings."
"There should be a 4x4 trail through the refuge."
"They had recently done a controlled burn at the refuge. I would have liked to have known this. It was not that day, very little shade on the trail and very few birds to be seen. Had i known this we would have chosen different trails to hike."
"This has a lovely preserve. A real diamond in the rough. Thank you, us government."
"This is a beautiful, well-maintained safe refuge. I appreciate the new environmental education facility and enjoy seeing young people touring the refuge with the volunteers. The people who use the refuge to walk or bird are a friendly group who share what they see. The new boardwalk out to puget sound is a welcome addition. The weekly bird walk, led by audubon volunteers, taught me a great deal as a beginning birder. I rely on their weekly reports on tweeters to direct my visits."
"This is a great place to take our grand kids and our dog to hike and see the desert. There are large mountain ranges on each side of the refuge with snow visible well into spring. With binoculars you can sometimes see mountain goats. The springs attract all kinds of critters, with coyote scat present all the time. There are large old trees down by the stream that form a kind of oasis in the desert, and make a great cooling off spot when the heat starts coming on. Only minutes from the las vegas strip, butwe usually only run into out of state visitors when we are there. A real shame more locals don't make use of this place."
"This is a great public space and it seems more and more people are taking advantage of it. There is, however, a need for better signage, especially regarding dogs! Dogs are not permitted and yet more and more people are bringing them into the refuge, especially after hours when the volunteers and/or employees have left the refuge. The trails were recently improved (finally!) And hopefully will, for the first time, be passable this winter, but the grass along the trails is cut but once or twice a year creating a health risk due to the very large deer tick population, especially for (young) children. Apart from these concerns things seem to be managed well."
"This is a great refuge which my wife and i visit about once a month. Please keep up the good work."
"This is a great refuge, easily accessible with walkable trails and a variety of wildflife and birds like no other place in and around the metropolitan philadelphia area. It's critical habitat that must be preserved for future generations. I love coming to this refuge. It's by far my favorite within the 20 mile radius surrounding philadelphia."
"This is a lengthy and cumbersome survey that most people will not take the time to complete. Start over and draft something shorter and simpler!"
"This is a marvelous refuge: great for birdwatching and easily accessible. Keep up the good work!"
"This is a nice refuge, but would benefit from more investment, including a visitor center and improved website describing the activities and trails available at the refuge. It does not seem like there is much promotion of the refuge as a visitor site--wewe staying in a motel about 10 minutes from the refuge, and mentioned it to another couple staying at the same place. They had not heard of the refuge, but sounded very interested to visit, once we told them about it."
"This is a small refuge with an ordinary number of birds but little wildlife. Coyotes are quite common and in twenty years i have seen two deer and too many rattle snakes. This refuge is used mostly for exercise walkers/dog walkers and mountain bikers. Thedirt trails are in very good condition and footing is not a problem. I am not a biker, but those who are seem to enjoy the varied terrain. We walk our dog here two or three days a week and most of the walkers/hikers and dog walkers are very considerateof one another. This is not a ""destination"" refuge, but more of a local ""hang out"" much appreciated by those of us who live in the area. We encourage visitors to pick up their trash and the refuge is quite clean."
"This is a very natural reserve without a lot of man-made attractions. The information on the trail about wildlife and plant life is good and could be expanded. It's not over crowded once on the trail and it attracts people of all abilities for hiking and biking. There are level trails and more difficult ones. It's nice and peaceful. It's very nice for a quite get away in the city."
"This is a very nice spot. I likely won't be back soon because i live 1500 miles away. I was in the area for another purpose. I sought out local birding spots, as i do virtually every time i travel. The most important features for me are quality habitat especially wetlands, and a wide variety of birds and other wildlife. Decent trails, clean restrooms, adequate signage and safety are also important. Thank you."
"This is a very well maintained park. I will likely return with 2 or 3 hiking friends within the next 12 months."
"This is a whole lot of paper."
"This is a wonderful example of putting natural features on display. This refuge was clean; the park employees were friendly & helpful and the experience could not have been better."
"This is a wonderful refuge for both wildlife and us passing humans. Thank you for your work and we look forward to returning."
"This is my favorite refuge and unfortunately, i now live halfway across the county. Was thrilled to get there for a visit...it had been three years! Hope to get back in a couple more years."
"This is my relaxation place. Check it on facebook at des wildlife photos or https://deswildlifephotos.myportfolio.com/?Fbclid=iwar2aabc7idvogtfldilbe-dgqvec1jxphpki-otukv9x12peeb0bexnxiw0 i send several photos to the staff to use for whatever programsthey need photos for. Great place, great people and the wildlife and scenery is beyond the greatest. I have visited refuges in washington state, minnesota and other states and feel like loess bluffs is the best by comparison. And the greatest thing is ican see it from my house! The couple that was taking the survey was polite and kind and very professional when approaching the vehicle. Just added to a great experience!"
"This is one of many pristine refuges in the usa. We need to keep, preserve and grow these last bastions of nature to preserve our natural heritage and the animals who occupy them"
"This is one of the few refuges with many developed recreational facilities. It has a special mandate that other refuges don't, for public recreation, including motorized boating. Over the years, refuge management has removed a huge amount of public recreation facilities, including 4 swimming beaches, a marina, marina concessions (can't even buy a bag of ice on the lake), group picnic areas (including tearing down pavilions), several boat ramps, many roads, numerous picnic areas, and campgrounds/parts of campgrounds. Accordingly, public use has declined substantially since the 1970s. We taxpayers paid for all that infrastructure but government bureaucrats decided to remove it to make our refuge fit the model for all other national refuges, where little infrastructure, if any, exists. But the special mandate for our refuge is still in place, for this infrastructure to support public use, other than merely wildlife oriented education. This refuge is in a relatively urban area, compared to most other refuges,where the public needed and made a lot of use of the infrastructure that has been removed. Most motorized boaters, with maybe the exception of bass fishermen, feel unwanted on the refuge and dread that we may be banned in the future. Please bring back asmuch of the removed infrastructure as possible. For example, crab orchard lake's main picnic area is in a mostly unshaded area right next to a busy highway, route 13. It'd be great if some of the other picnic areas, such as lookout point, cambria neck, and others could be reinstated. We also need a concessionaire at crab orchard marina so we can obtain staples like ice and bait. In the meantime, with public use at such a low point, reduce some of the funding for law enforcement into developing more public use areas and eradicating invasive plant species."
"This is one of the largest & most diverse refuges in the united states. However, the usfws policies do not allow for or support institutional memory - it is important to have long term staff who are invested in the area, the refuge and who know its rich history. Staff are forced to move every 3-5 years for promotion. Local people, talented people are hired in temporary jobs only, forced to go to other states for permanent employment. This is unfair and creates numerous problems in running ee programs"
"This is such a beautiful refuge and we love to visit the area at least once a year since we have family who live nearby."
"This is such a wonderful refuge to visit, in all seasons of the year. It is a magical place to visit in winter, and there is so much to see - i can spend 3-4 hours driving the auto tour route when the ducks and raptors are out in full force. It is workingextremely well right now from a visitor's standpoint - please do not try to develop it by putting in a fancy visiter center. Many visitors prefer and undeveloped refuge experience. Going to ridgefield NWR makes me glad to pay my taxes for this kind of service, being ablt to visit it is a true benefit that my government provides. (I wish i could direct all my tax dollars to the refuge system.)"
"This is the finest NWR in delaware, with lots of habitat diversity and dedicated staff and volunteers. It is a wonderful asset to the state and sussex county. It should be noted that although i live in the washington dc area, i own property in dewey beach, about 20miles from the refuge, and am usually based there when visiting the refuge."
"This place is amazing. I have been coming here my whole life. I've planted trees on the island whenever i was in middle school. My kids enjoy it too."
"This refuge and another in the other my primary concern is for safety as i stated previously. It would be nice if visitors were told there was surveillance at the entry. I have experienced suspicious visitors in the parking areas and actually left the refuges because of the situation."
"This refuge became my refuge when my dad passed away. I took my grandchildren here to regain stability and to show them a piece of the world that continues to thrive. We all came to love this place and i have recommended it to many people for various activities. I love the peaceful atmosphere and watching nature. I feel safe when i hike the dikes and do not feel hurried to leave. The staff or volunteers have always been helpful and very friendly. I feel fortunate to have such a beautiful place to visit soclose to my home."
"This refuge has amazing diversity of species, and beautiful landscapes! It's a wonderful recreation spot near our home!!"
"This refuge have remove all camping areas and water sports other that fishing and hunting are not allowed. There used to be camping areas and swimming, skiing, etc. was allowed. I and my children learned to water ski, ride tube, etc at this lake. They have destroyed all the trees around the lake that the bald eagles used to nest and roost in. Now the eagles are no longer around. There is very little places to pull off to fish from the bank and there is now handicap access anywhere."
"This refuge is a gem and can be improved by removing the numerous downed trees blocking easy and safe access down cane bayou.also,there seems to be a proliferation of giant salvinia that may dramatically impact the waterfowl habitat.keeping the refuge free of mudboats is also a great idea."
"This refuge is a jewel! A wonderful resource!"
"This refuge is a wonderful aspect of the community! The informational postings can be improved with more detailed information about the wildlife and the trail itself. The information are quite broad. Interactive postings an also improve the area. There have been problems with visitors ignoring the 'do not enter' postings and walking into areas restricted to visitors. This issue can perhaps be explored to find better ways of keeping visitors from entering restricted areas."
"This refuge is a wonderful place for viewing birds and other wildlife. Many opportunities for volunteers are available for those interested."
"This refuge is becoming overrun with autumn olive an invasive species. Also the refuge needs a lot more grasslands for wild turkey brood areas!!"
"This refuge is one of my favorite places to hike and i feel lucky to live close to it."
"This refuge is our favorite place to enjoy. When we are able to use the hiking trails during the non-hunting portion of the year the refuge is an escape from the stresses of work. It's an amazing place to observe and photograph migratory birds and the many resident birds and animals. During the spring and summer, it would be an improvement if closing the refuge for the day occurred at dusk, rather than sunset. There are many good photography opportunities a few minutes after sunset that are lost having toleave before the automatic gate closes. However, we greatly appreciate the care of the local folks who work at and around our refuge."
"This refuge is utilized everyday and almost every hour by people in the community including young families, recreational exercisers, wildlife photographers and wildlife game watchers, kayakers, etc. The island is well maintained and provides a safe, comfortable environment for all who visit."
"This refuge seems to be less cared for than the other refuges we have been in. This includes boardwalks and habitat."
"This survery was way too long!!"
"This survey has way too many questions. Love the refuge."
"This survey is entirely too long."
"This survey is for the san diego bay national wildlife refuge. However, this refuge is one piece of a larger one being cobbled together with private developer mitigation lands, lands owned by two cities, as well as lands owned by the county, state and national. So it is a complex endeavor that i am told is near completion. However, the sdbNWR is the only one with outreach to hear from the public. Other areas have been closed intirely without public input and before a master recreational trail plan has been developed."
"This survey is too long and has somewhat repetitive questions!"
"This survey is too long! Please remove me from your mailing list"
"This survey is too long. I did no finish."
"This survey is too long. I did not complete it."
"This survey is way too long and has a lot of redundancy. I almost gave up."
"This survey is way too long to be effective...talk about fatigue."
"This survey really got my interest because of its focus on transportation. I work for the federal highway administration and lead the federal lands road inventory program for fws, nps, and usbr. My team inventories and collects condition on the transportation assets (roads and parking) in these federal lands. I spend a lot of personal time in the refuges and parks too, which was my primary reason for visiting ohio river islands (driving from my parents home in ohio back to where i live now in virginia) .However, even when i'm visiting for personal recreation my eye is trained to notice the road and parking conditions because that's the focus of my work. I also went to grad school at ohio state and got my master's in civil engineering transportation. I'mcurious to see the results of your survey and research, and it's great to see osu's interest in federal lands (i'll actually be on campus in september attending a career fair). If you want to reach out to me here is my email: brandon.strohl@dot.gov"
"This survey really, really needs a line that shows how far along a participant is in the survey. I came so close to quitting several times. After i was about half way through the survey, i thought for sure every page afterwards would be the last page. Itwas very frustrating not knowing how close i was to being done, as it took longer than i expected."
"This survey was a little too long"
"This survey was a waste of time for such a small refuge that really only provides limited seabird and coastline viewing opportunities and not much else."
"This survey was too long! Cut it back!"
"This survey was very long and difficult to complete on a phone. Some of it was repetitious or did not apply which was a waste of my time."
"This survey was way too long."
"This was a long survey. I almost didn't complete it, but my experience at the mojone desert refuge was really wonderful even this all i did was sky on tuet loney oasis around the center. I was in not planning on going anywhere in particular. Just wanted aplace to shoot some smart photos which i found. I used the woman who was working at the center first day. She was terrific!"
"This was a really neat refuge, and our expectations were exceeded"
"This was a spur-of-the-moment side trip that we made while en route from portland to a cabin near mt. Rainier. It was pleasant and worth going a little out of our way."
"This was long and repetitive"
"This was one of the highlights of my trip to olympia. I went to olympia twice this summer because i am considering relocating to washington from arizona, and olympia is one of the possibilities. The first time i visited nisqually, i was directed there by the man at the visitors center next to the capitol building in downtown olympia. I asked him where i could see some good birds, and he said, ""do i have the place for you!"" He was right. The next time i visited olympia, less than a month later, was for a job interview, and i made sure i took the time to visit the refuge again."
"This was quite a survey. Any thoughts on giving an honorary memberships?"
"This was way too long. Lot of the ?S did not pertain to the refuge i visited."
"This wildlife refuge is one of the great finds in a lifetime. This evening i saw two otters in the canal. Last week a bald eagle snagging a fish. A month ago a redwing blackbird riding on the back of a great heron. And the diversity of wildflowers is sucha joy. The diversity of birds ..... there is a great and humbling symphony of life layer upon layer here. Over the past 3 years i find myself visiting more and more often. There is always a gift to experience !"
"Thoroughly enjoyed visiting and learning at the refuge."
"Though we currently live in florida, i have been visiting ottawa national wildlife refuge for over 50 years since i grew up in nearby oregon, ohio. It has been managed very well over the years, and the visitor center was a very nice addition."
"Thoughts surveys were confidential so how do you know i didn't return mine?!?!"
"Through no fault of your own, i got a very bad case of poison ivy in mid-august despite walking only on the pathways. I'm not sure if i'm overly susceptible or if it was airborne, but this is the only reason i may not be returning to you refuge soon. It is a beautiful place though."
"Time marches on. Probably a million dollars spent on this facility which i intend to google. However, there could have been a part of the area left in an intact wetland wilderness or more pictures mounted to people could see how it was before and why andhow the indigenous people used this treasure of an area. Corn creek. June maier g8isgr8@yahoo.com"
"Tinicum wildlife--- needed to be cutback a little--- don't remember being that dense on the wakways"
"Tn national wildlife refuge is a treasure. The trump govt shutdown was a disgrace. Impeachment now!"
"To whom it my concern, i have been going to this lake for more than 55 years. I totally disagree the way this refuge is run. I believe there were far more animals around this lake before it was a refuge. Mainly because of removal of trees, shelter belts etc. Also believe this lake was built for flood control, irragation & recreation, not a refuge. I don't know how money is spent here but its to much!"
"Too far from home for a return visit but it was beautiful."
"Too long"
"Too long!"
"Too many questions"
"Too many silly and stupid questions."
"Took my 8 year old granddaughter to the wildlife refuge at canaan valley while at our family's time share at land of canaan. I had seen information at the nearby grocery store and my great - nice was friends with one of the rangers. My granddaughter enjoyed the children's activities that day, and spent time looking at and reading information on the display. Very enjoyable experience!"
"Took way too long to complete."
"Top notch refuge. don't change a thing! Ok, so more beavers and otters would be nice."
"Trails should be graded more often.trail should be open year round."
"Tried doing it on safari, but it wouldn't let"
"Tualatin river wildlife refuge is a very attractive and welcoming place. I live about 13 miles away"
"Unfortunately we got there too late for the gift shop this trip but the rangers were very helpful and let us look around anyhow. Kudos!"
"Unfortunately, invasive plants have gotten a deep hold on the refuge grounds. Their management would be difficult."
"Unique pin wfsp"
"Unlock the gates to accomadate horseback riding!"
"Value the diversity of habitat and species. Incredible learning opportunities and appreciate the conservation and management efforts."
"Very good program, keep up the good work."
"Very important to keep native habitats for future generations"
"Very interesting survey! People go by the sign that say keep out they walk into danger. Like at the big pond it says no people beyond this point. They go anyways."
"Very nice place. We love to visit. I would be nice to some restrooms in another place or two."
"Very nice trails and visitor center. The staff was very helpful and informative."
"Very odd i never heard of this place until recently. Maybe that is good for a wildlife refuge? True, even for a leave no trace, human-powered outdoor rec guy like me."
"Very well staffed and enjoyable!"
"Visitor center is very nice, clean, and well kept. Employees are good people and friendly. Public relations with local people are good. Needs, roadway need upgrading. Base materials are in place. The flex base needs to be re-worked and brought too section. Then it needs to be finished with a topping of asphalt or concrete. The excuse that it will be underwater will not do. If damage occurs in such a short time; repairs can be done at once. Something must be done to control the dust problem that everyoneis experiencing. The dust problem is a deterrant to the wildlife and the refuge visitors and the traffic thru the refuge. Your attention to this problem and any improvement will be appreciated - believe me"
"Visting canaan valley NWR is always a positive experience. I live near-by & utilize the refuge on a regular bases."
"Volunteering here is a very strong likelyhood for me. I look forward to constant learning and enjoyment. It is becoming my outdoor several-times-weekly retreat."
"Volunteers were so great. They helped with maps and described where to go. When leaving my kids used the restroom and a volunteer showed them a bird making a nest near by."
"Walking tours would be great, occasional small golf cart tours would be okay. However, if the park were to have many amenities, lots of human noise, large motorized vehicle tours, bicycles on trails, and many people fishing and hunting, it would no longer feel like a refuge for wildlife, but instead like a tourist attraction. This would cause me great concern for the health and safety of the wildlife, water, and flora. The greater the human and mechanized traffic, the less natural the refuge would feel. If the refuge were to change in this way, not only would i loose interest in visiting, but i would feel sad for the loss. I believe wildlife refuges are meant to be wild life refuges foremost and are necessary; a source of pride for the country, stateand the local area - and not to cater to tourist or promote consumer spending in the local area. People who truly enjoy wildlife and wilderness will always come."
"Want to thank all at the refuge for answering questions over the years for not only my sons but myself as well. Looking forward to bringing my grand daughter to see all you have to offer, she is going to love it! Thank you for all you do and provide to the community."
"Was disappointed the river trail was closed as i was there primarily to observe turtles. Surprised the people doing this survey didn't know the trail was closed."
"Was lovely to visit this area of the country on our recent visit to the states, hope to return one day"
"Was very pleased with my first visit to the refuge. My wife and brother in law also enjoyed that visit."
"Water is clean and clear"
"Waterfowl numbers especially canada goose populations have really declined over the years on the tn national wildlife refuge. Why?"
"We've been visiting ding darling yearly since 1974. We know the area well."
"We (my wife and i) love visiting the refuge at every opportunity and only wish it could be open (the auto tour) longer than 4 months."
"We always enjoy our time at the facility and we would love to visit more often if those roads were fixed. Thanks for keeping this refuge on our island."
"We are buckeyes!"
"We are fortunate and happy to have the ottawa national wildlife refuge in our home proximity."
"We are lucky to have this center in our area"
"We are rver's and travel the us yearly. One of our favorite activities is geocaching which brought us to the refuge. We were able to use the bicycle paths to find the hidden caches. This was an enjoyable day."
"We are thankful for what the refuge is now. Too many improvements could take some of the charm out of it. Easy access restrooms and a couple more parking spots with hc access would be nice."
"We are very lucky to have a partner in the lacombe area with the wildlife and fishery. The wildthings event held in october of each year is a very big success and st. Tammany parish comes out to support the event each year."
"We come here sometimes 3 times a year to experience the different seasons and it's always beautiful, with the trails through grasslands and walking near the ocean. It is a fabulous wildlife refuge."
"We did not have much time to visit, but agreed this refuge is worthy of another, longer visit and exploration."
"We drove from western new york to visit hilton head, sc about 950 miles. Did not know about the wild life refuge until seeing a brochure in a rack at the hotel. Sadly, we did not have enough time to see all but what we did see was well worthwhile. We would gladly return next time we get to the area. The word ""complaint"" is awfully strong but the one concern i had was not knowing the area and driving on a divided highway with signage that was not all that good. We spotted the turnoff at the last minute before the road went up over a hump back bridge. The turn would have been missed had there been more traffic on the road."
"We enjoy having refuge so close to our home. We drive by it alot and it seems like lots of people stop to enjoy it as well. Would like to see more of these in our area... and throughout the country."
"We enjoy the observation deck on the big sandy wildlife refuge. We are glad the water area is closed for these birds to enjoy throughout the winter."
"We enjoy the outdoors and have visited wildlife refuges & national parks in alaska, wyoming, utah, nc, sc, ga and co in recent months. Thank you for furthering the research & opportunities for public access to nature. We are grateful & appreciate of our parks & wildlife services in the u.s. and enjoy hiking, biking, boating, photography and wildlife observation as well as fishing in a variety of locales made accessible through our governmental agencies."
"We enjoyed meeting and talking with your representatives."
"We enjoyed our two visits to the refuge while vacationing in the area. My only concern was that we noticed a red mylar balloon in the wetlands. When we returned to the office, we notified the staff of the balloon so it could be removed before it harmedany wildlife. When we returned two days later for our second visit, i was alarmed to see the balloon was still there. We notified the office staff again, but since we were leaving that day, i can't be sure if/when it was removed. It made me a little concerned that it was not a higher priority considering how balloons are known to harm/injure/kill animals and birds."
"We enjoyed our visit and plan to return next year."
"We enjoyed our visit but we needed more time. The highlight was getting to see an eagle catch a fish in the lake."
"We enjoyed our visit very much. We are not local so whenever we return to visit our tigard friends we would probably visit the refuge again, however we don't visit every year. The refuge appears to be very well run and everyone was very friendly."
"We feel blessed to have moved to an area that offers such a nice, educational, and clean place to learn, explore nature, and have fun. Only wish they could advertise or get information out to community better for all the programs they offer are top notchyetso few seem to know they are there. I first found out about them at an earth day exhibit at a local university. Thank you to all that allow these places to be available as free to community, families, and travelers, alike."
"We greatly enjoy middle island for walking, running and occasional biking. We take our local cross country team there on hot summer days to run to stay out of the heat and enjoy the trails and solitude of not a lot of people there. Please, keep this island well manicured and mowed on roadways and trails for walking, running, photography and wildlife, but do not add additional ""recreation"" type activities. No playgrounds, no picnic areas, no horseshoes. These activities area all available 1 mile away at the st. Marys park. These activities tend to draw, clutter, food, and trash along with smoking. We don't want that near our wildlife and the environment this island brings. We love it the way it is. If we wanted a park we'd go to the park. We like the solitude and wildlife feel of the island. We also enjoy it not being very busy because its not a ""park and recreation"" area. Thank you!"
"We greatly enjoyed our visits to magee marsh and the ottawa wildlife refuge. The driving trail was excellent and the volunteers at both sites were very helpful in pointing out where we would find eagles nests that could be respectfully observed. Greatwork being done."
"We had a great time & on our exit there was an injured eagle. We notified the refuge. They thanked us and said they would respond."
"We had a lovely spontaneous visit to prime hook NWR. We were on our home from bethany beach where we usually make an annual visit and decided to make a stop. We have passed the signs for many years and talked about stopping but never had because of timeconstraints. This year we had more flexibility and decided to make some stops on the way home. We checked out the exhibits at the visitor center and watched a informational video and interacted with the volunteer staffing the center that day. He was informative and helpful. And.. my sons got new stamps in their nps passports. We did some light hiking and then the driving tour of the refuge. We enjoyed seeing a variety of birds and experiencing the refuge. I'm so glad we took the time to visit and am only sorry that i did not do it sooner."
"We had a wonderful time. We felt welcome and learned about nature. We definitely will be returning especially in the fall when the snow geese migrate. One of the volunteers told us that it's an amazing sight."
"We had a wonderful visit. Diane that volunteers at the refuge told us about it, we met her camping the area with the largest setka spruce tree. We were visiting from va so we wanted to see all that we could. We were so lucky to run across her and her tellus to visit. Thanks wanda and family"
"We had a wonderful visit. It was very hot the day we were there, but we took the trail though the woods and the water bridge. We hoped to see some elk, but they wer hiding from the heat we assume. We will tell friends and family about this preserve."
"We had lots of fun!!"
"We have a wheelchair bound 13 year old, i'd love to see some sort of beach access planking mat so wheelchairs (and also strollers) could get onto the beach if only for a limited distance..."
"We have been visiting this refuge since the 1970s, we have noticed a marked decrease in the number of water birds between then & now. Not sure if this is a refuge management problem, or just a worrisome trend nation-wide in bird populations. Because we live so close to this refuge, it is on our daily walking route several times a week. If they needed people to contribute sightings of birds or other wildlife, we would be happy to help."
"We have fought since we moved to sequim to banhunting at this refuge - as it sent a bad message - refuge? Also increased use and walking paths made it very unsafe. There has been an increase in bluff erosion and some bluff trails have been redirected forsafety, that is understandable, but there has been no thought put into these new paths, no winding, or interesting scenery - just a straight foot path - very boring. There has been increased discussion on taking out more woodlands to increase rv camping sites. I htink that should be left alone, and not increaed, this is what makes it so desirable - it will lose the ambiance, and become a walmart parking lot. I would hate to see this happen. Enhancing those woodlands, horse and foot trails would be greatermoney spent. Thank you!"
"We have had many great experiences, varied each time, at the kilauea lighthouse. It is always a stop on our drive around the island."
"We have lake property at big lake which is near the refuge. We enjoy seeing the wildlife and birds on the refuge."
"We have owned a fishing house in kirwin ks for 18 years. There have been many changes in the refuge over those years and also in the communities surrounding the lake. In the refuge plan it stated there would never be anything done at the refuge to effectthe economy of the local communities but that is not the case. When they made the lake a non recreational boating lake was alright due due the fact it was primarily a fishing lake anyway but when they stopped camping on the lake they killed the revenue generation of the local small communities. Restaurants, gas stations, bait shops and grocery stores closed down. A sad situation for the communities and if it wasn't for the people like us that own fishing cabins and pay water and sewer etc in the town it may not be able to survive. Just food for thought when making decisions in refuge management."
"We have purchased a book about all the wildlife refuges in the u.s. Due to my birding activities we've been to several in texas, louisiana, arizona, utah, montana and other states. We had not been to those along the mississippi. We traveled along i-55 from st. Louis - south along the missouri side. We tavelled as far as yazoo NWR then returned along the east side of the mississippi. We're scoping out places for possible fall and spring trips in the future."
"We have recently taken up birding. We really enjoyed ""warbler woods"", and the many great blue herons and egrets. Also, were pleasantly surprised to see the resident bald eagle perched in the tree right where the refuge sign suggested!"
"We just attended pioneer day and enjoyed talking to the talented people who participated. My husband and i talked with a volunteer from almost every booth. We know the hardships people faced and admire their tenacity. We usually ride our bikes each day for exercise and bird watching. I am pleased that we have the park close enough to visit often."
"We kayaked in from the kayak rental outside the refuge. It was lovely - flowers in the water, turtles, birds. We also drove into the refuge just to observe wildlife but the road conditions were less than ideal. This visit was just part of a longer visit to hawaii from the mainland. We are unlikely to return in the near future just because of the distance from home."
"We learned of this refuge many years ago when our sons' boy scout troop would do a campout each december to go to eagle days. We thoroughly enjoyed the presentation and other activities that are offered during eagle days and the boys' learned a lot. Now that both sons are no longer in scouts, my husband and i still try to get up there each december to see the eagles and other birds. We try to go after the eagle days weekend mainly due to the crowd. We like to take our time driving the refuge and seeing the eagles at a leisurely pace without a lot of people around. This year we were happy to see at least 2 adult eagles and a number of juvenile eagles."
"We like to fish for crappie and walleye and lately it seems like the population in this lake is dwindling ."
"We live close to the refuge and visit it frequently, taking guests when they visit us. I am especially happy dogs aren't allowed at this refuge. Thank you for caring for our refuge and keeping it accessible to us."
"We live in arizona, visiting our daughter in portland."
"We live in boston. Not likely to do another trip to the area. The area was great. If i lived locally i would certainly visit yearly."
"We live pretty close to sullys hill and try to go there occasionally. We are older and so this survey really doesn't apply to us right now. Everything at sullys hill is good. We were both raised in the area so are quite familiar with it. Always been good..."
"We love coming back as often as possible! It's always an exciting trip to see in each season, seeing the scenery, the bird life, and other animals and creatures! We love the nature center! A photography class would be fun to learn better ways to capture photos of birds! Additional movies about what to look for that is in the refuge would be nice. We will be back!!! Thank you for being so kind to my wife, her cousin and me ... what a pleasure!!!!"
"We love hiking and bird and nature watching during all seasons at this refuge."
"We love it because it is close and well-maintained--even thought we basically just walk there and enjoy all that nature has to offer."
"We love loess bluffs refuge. We visit there at least once a year. Each experience is unique and we always see something new or different each trip. We plan to visit quivira refuge in the spring."
"We love NWRs!"
"We love sherburne!!!"
"We love squaw creek. The young man representing you was really fun to visit with and learn from. We visit fairly often. I used to take my father from a nearby nursing home there. He loved the peace and ability to just sit and enjoy. I got some great video of the geese circling and getting ready for flight. Each visit has its own wonder..."
"We love that this refuge is free and so close to home. Our children feel like the animals are ours. It's very special that they get to experience the refuge so often."
"We love the billy frank jr. Wildlife refuge & reserve!!!!!"
"We love the heinz refuge! We live in center city and have been frequent visitors for the last several years. It is always well maintained, and employees are always friendly. Our primary activity has always been walking or running, but we are hoping to start biking as well."
"We love the refuge. The views are lovely and it is enjoyed by all ages giving us time to enjoy nature, do a healthy activity (walking) and respite from the busy noisy world we live in. Thank you for youe endeavors to evaluate these special places."
"We love the sachuest point national wildlife refuge! That only thing we didn't like about our visit was seeing a picture of donald trump and mike pence on the wall."
"We love the sherburne refuge. We have a lake house nearby and in addition to the valued opportunities to view wildlife within the refuge, the refuge provides the communities outside its boundaries with wide and wonderful varieties of birds to view."
"We love the stigerwald refuge and enjoy visiting whenever we are in the area"
"We love this refuge. We like watching it change week to week and year to year. My wife and i use it to spend time together, just us."
"We love this wildlife refuge. Many, many birds are dependent on it."
"We love to camp here with our camper. We go often. The staff is very helpful and friendly."
"We love walking and biking on the island. We are blessed to have access to such a lovely place so close to home."
"We love wildlife refuges for birdwatching, and just getting fresh air. They are very relaxing and contribute to well being and good mental health."
"We loved our visit! Saw lots of wildlife. Appreciated opportunities to pull over to view wildlife. Visitors center offered informational movie. Attendent at visitor center helpful in giving us information. Wish i lived closer because i would visit often.keep preserving our wildlife and land."
"We loved this place. The juxtaposition against farmland and nearby urban decay really emphasized the uniqueness of the ecosystem."
"We make a point to visit this refuge every october when the ""birdfest"" event is held (we missed 2017 due to a scheduling conflict. We might visit one or two additional times per year -- schedule permitting. We like the refuge and its state of development as it is; it's hard to think of how it could be improved for the mutual benefit of people and birds. And i would hate for it to become a victim of its success with too many people visiting and ""loving it to death"". I mentioned in a previous ""comments"" box in this survey that the experience would probably not benefit much from any kind of public transportation offered because you need a personal vehicle travelling at your speed to match the ""schedule of the blue heron's or the egret's food foray. A fleet of - for nominal rental fee -- electric golf cart-sized (or slightly larger) vehicles for traveling the refuge roads would be about the only new improvement i could think of."
"We miss the wildlife."
"We need to have restrooms at both locations. We need need light at both locations."
"We need to keep pressure on the current administration to increase, not decrease funding for national wildlife refuges! I attend a songbird festival at balcones canyon national wildlife refuge which has geared toward birders, but during our daily field trips i saw many families with small teenage children enjoying the hiking paths. Research has shown that exposure to nature is extremely beneficial to the mental, physical and emotional well being of young people. Since the current administration has no interest in preserving wildlife for wildlife's sake, advocates for national parks & wildlife refuges should emphasize the tangible health benefits to people of all ages, incomes and backgrounds."
"We only viewed 2 small areas of this refuge on the boardwalk/nature trails. People in the area indicated that hurrican katrina had a significant impact on the refuge. We did not see the amount of birdlife that we had hoped to see in late march. We visitedthis refuge on a trip to louisianna. We went there as part of our goal to visit all 50 states. We do not plan to return to louisanna so we do not plan to visit this refuge again."
"We own a vacation-house in canaan valley adjacent to the state park boundaries. We have owned it since 1986 and use it at least monthly. This puts us in a unique position relative to the wildlife area and the services you have surveyed. Thank you for doing this, michael a. Brenton"
"We primarily went for hiking and only realized it was a refuge because of this survey."
"We purchased a home in drexel hill as it was within a 20 minute drive to the john heinz refuge where i would be able to go to after work to enjoy canoeing and kayaking and nature viewing and wetlands exploration. It was important to use we live near a ""wilder space"" despite being near the city and burbs. With the launch broken most of this season it really made me remember how important this time in the refuge is to me. I value the wildlife conservation you all do. I hope that the 130 plus acres are purchased by federal and mixed dollars so that the refuge space can continue to grow. This unique habitat of a tidally influenced pa wetland along the delaware river is essential. Its the larger urban refuge and i will happily continue to help it grow larger. Thanks for all you do."
"We really enjoy the programs offered for children at the tualatin national wildlife refuge. The staff and the volunteers are always so friendly and helpful. My only wish is that we were allowed to go running on the trails."
"We really enjoyed our visit and look forward to coming again. We spend quite a bit of time at state and national parks, and were really impressed by the maintenance of the refuge and the parks we visited while in the area - the boardwalks were all well maintained which made it easy to bring our two year old out on nature walks. I really appreciated the refuge's visitor's center's openness in teaching the history of the environmental toll that has been taken on the area. I hope the refugecontinues to be properly funded to continue its conservation efforts and wonderful facilities."
"We really enjoyed visiting the okefenokee NWR. The boat tour was especially rewarding. We would return more often, but we live in alaska."
"We saw 3 turtles."
"We sometimes get a little lost on trails. The park is small enough that we can eventually find ourselves again."
"We speak german and french in our couple. I hope that i understood your questions well. Good bye."
"We stayed at maumee state park. Please advertise your programs at the park. Remember it was difficult for us to find the correct entrance to the refuge."
"We stumbled upon this refuge due to highway signage. Loved it so much that we hiked at the bailey tract every day of our 2 week visit. Thank you for your often thankless work. :-) good luck with your research."
"We stumbled upon this refuge when looking for a place to visit on our way to a wedding. We enjoyed the day we were able to spend here. Great place"
"We support wildlife efforts 100%"
"We thoroughly enjoyed the visits to ding darling and tarpon bay during our 6 day visit. We were excited to participate in any activity that was available and would have returned had we been in the area for more time. We plan to return to sanibel islandin the future because of the reserve and the land stewardship on the island. We will definitely return to the refuge!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed visiting okefenokee and would highly recommend any friends and family to visit."
"We use this facility only for fishing"
"We used to live in guam, military family. Since the moment we found this place we always love it. It is a place dear in our hearts our kids love it. It was one of our favorites places to go in the island. In total years taht we lived there 5 1/2 years. Now we had the opportunity to go back and visit it was amazing to see that it still almost the sames. Including the bad conditions on the the road there. This palce should stay just like it is. Maybe restroom would be a very nice thing. We loved to see thisplace to stay open for future generations to come. We are so grateful for visiting the wonderful place. Is wehere our kids grow up, loving and respecting the ocean."
"We very much enjoyed the visit to this park. You have positioned the park as an excellent learning experience for the spectrum of people enjoying this venue. However the actions of your president do not make canadians welcome. 3 billion spent for fruit &vegetables in florida & california winter alone. Why would unwlecome people return. My retired peers are rethinking this as well!!!"
"We visited as part of the wings of winter birding program offered by local bird partner enthusiasts and enjoyed our visit. I look forward to returning when the visitors center is open to further explore it and at different times in the year to see the refuge during different seasons."
"We visited the ottawa national wildlife refuge in the spring and summer. Thoroughly enjoyed to self drive tour and saw numerous species that we otherwise would not have seen keep up the great work!"
"We visited the refuge after attending the bird festival in carrington. We live in wa state and this was probably a one time visit for us. We enjoyed the bird watching and wildlife viewing. We enjoyed visiting a habitat normally not found in nd."
"We visited the refuge to observe sandhill cranes staging at the refuge prior to southerly migration. There were lots of birds to observe and we were pleased that we were able to observe them so closely. I will try to get out there more frequently in the future as we live so close to the refuge."
"We visited this refuge on a vacation to hawaii. Some of the questions (mainly the ones pertaining to visiting within the last/next 12 months) do not apply to me."
"We went on a low tide kayak tour with tarpon bay explorers, then continued on our own in the bay before going down the commodore creek trail (as far as we could, as water was still too low to complete the trail). Loved these hours we spent. Saw a bald eagle descend upon a flock and capture breakfast!! Are there any guided hikes or ranger/volunteers with expertise at the observation towers at specific times to help locate & identify birds? If not that would be nice. (this ties into my answer to sec.6 item 3: programs that teach skills to visitors)"
"We were in new orleans for 6 days and took a day trip to kayak w/canoe & trail adventures at the boat launch at big branch. We spent the day kayaking and visiting 2 local breweries. Very fun!"
"We were in the area for a conference. Whenever we travel, we look for wildlife refuges to spend some time bird watching, wildlife watching, and/or hiking. It is especially satisfying when we travel by air to a large urban setting, and can easily accessa refuge by rental car or public transportation. It is wonderful to be able to go beyond the 'normal tourist attractions' to see the local wildlife."
"We were in town visiting family and our family recommended we visit the refuge. We really enjoyed the visit and wildlife we saw. Wildlife refuges like this are important to maintain and expand when possible so others can experience wildlife in their natural habitat. If we return to seattle, we would likely return to the refuge. Thank you and god bless!"
"We were on a family visit from england and therefore many of the questions were not relevant to my situation. We have been several times before to the refuge but only managed two trips this year and both times we were limited in what we could do becausean accident had limited my wife's mobility."
"We were on a motorcycle ride in backwoods ms and al and just happened on to this beautiful area. Total surprise and very pleased"
"We were on holiday in new orleans and found the kayak trip we went on very well recommended on trip advisor. the trip was very well organised with extremely helpful and knowledgeable guides and was one of the highlights of our holiday."
"We were on vacation. We probably won't make it back to hawaii in our lifetime. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there."
"We were pleasantly surprised at the attitude of the employees. they were great people and the facilities neat and clean. keep up the good work."
"We were very impressed with dungeness NWR and hope to return to this NWR if we are back in the area. 5 stars, 10/10, a+. Keep up the good work :)"
"We were visiting from outside the states. The visit on this occasion was intended as an outing for the kids to burn some energy and for the adults to get some fresh air. The skiing conditions on that particular day were not good and a short hike/walk wasa great way to avoid cabin fever."
"We will visit this refuge several times next year. Great walk and wonderful wildlife, especially birds."
"We would support development of additional natural refuge areas rather than significant development of any one area. Too many people a challenge for the wildlife."
"When approached to participate in this survey, i believe i was in the san diego nat'l wildlife refuge complex on the sweetwater river upstream from the bay refuge. Therefore, i was a little confused as to how to respond. I visit both areas for differentwildlife experiences. Since the cover letter specifically referred to the san diego bay refuge, i answered the questions for the bay location."
"When are you to start selling ""it's cool to care about fish and wildlife"" t-shirts?"
"When bridge construction starts, it would be nice to have a temporary walkway across the bridge so people can still enjoy the island."
"When we visit nw ohio for birding ,we always stop at ottawa as well as magee marsh and metzger marsh."
"Whenever i travel i look for opportunities to visit wildlife refuges, parks, national forests, etc. Our natural resources are priceless. I have made it a mission to open the eyes of boy scouts, audubon members, and friends and family to hagerman NWR. I'dlove to be able to share my photography with refuge staff."
"Where are the wildlife? The pools are dryed up and there is no water fowl, more deer outside the refuge then inside. Maybe because of the grass fields. If grass fields are so great why do the deer go out of the refuge to eat? College educated biologist need to spend more time in the field instead of the office! Just like any government program it is screwed up. Wasting our tax dollars. I am very disappointed in the way this refuge has gone down the tubes and i am not alone aks any of the local people!"
"Whew!"
"While my visit was short, i thoroughly enjoyed it and hope that i make it back to the area."
"While visiting hawaii, we visited the bird refuge after reading about it on the internet. We appreciated it but did not attend a group visit (though we did hear a bit the volunteer who gave informations about the history of the lighthouse and the guide seemed interesting). We went to the visitor center and bought books we were looking for (one on fishes we could see while snorkling and one on the history/culture of hawaii). We were very happy with our purchase since there are so few libraries on kauai island! About your survey, it is much too long and the questions much too specific to my taste...I tried to answer to my best in the first pages but lost interest after a while...so my answers are very approximate (how much we spent...) and i eventually stopped completing. The last answers are not exact, as i tried to erase them but could only change them... My recommandation would be to have a much shorter survey if you wish for a better participation!"
"Why did you have to mail me a card in order for me to participate in this survey? Also, survey should work on mobile platforms. Go bucks!"
"Wild life improvements that have been done. They are not working. I see them destroy this place and kill off a lot of wild life and fish every year. This refuge is in the middle of prime duck and deer hunting but they will not hold water in the duck holes. They are pushing trees down in piles after they drain the low lands."
"Wild thing was a great experience for my grand daughters and their father. We come every year."
"Wild things is an excellent family fun day to spend learning about our area and what we can do to help. This is an awesome opportunity to learn, respect and become aware of our enviroment. Great fun activities with young children. We go every year ."
"Wildlife refuges, state parks & national parks are extremely important to me & my family!"
"Wish access for birdwatchers was available for more months of the year."
"Wish more light house tours were offered other than just on wednesday and saturday."
"With a single lane road going one way only makes it difficult driving through refuge and trying to sightsee the wildlife when other vehicles are on your bumper and wanting to pass. Another instance while we were dirving through, a visitor proceeded to goahead of us on their motorbike and speed through making loud motor noises and throwing dust and stone up from the gravel one lane road. This in turn would frighten any wildlife and therefore ruin our drive through to be able to observe & enjoy the wildlife. These people are very rude. I wish there wser park officers of some sort that were there or available to supervise this kind of behavior in a national refuge. There were none in both instances when we were there. This makes ;me question safety for thevisitor, the wildlife and the lands if there are no park rangers available at all times while park is accessible during visiting hours."
"Wonderful place!!! Would be better if path put in from second campground dog side of road to make it safe to welcome from second beach"
"Wonderful place. Thank you for all the hard work that goes into public land. I wish we had more land for people to enjoy"
"Wonderful visit ps-to the person entering all of the info-thank you"
"Would be nice for people to know that they can come back at different times of the year and expect to see different birds. Example swans in the winter, they will not be here in the summer passes are good all day. Could suggest taking the auto tour inthe morning, visit the the nearby town or other wildlife refuge section, have lunch ..... then return. Most likely will see different birds for sure !"
"Would it be possible to receive a sticker from your organization for my daughter? She is studying to be a marine biologist and she would love that. She is a senior at stoneman douglas in parkland. My email address is jcsantoro@bellsouth.net . Thank you for your consideration."
"Would like to be able to walk to the lake or along the lake!"
"Would like to see more animals relative to area."
"Would like to see more water in the refuge pools for the migrating geese fall and spring."
"Would love to bring dogs."
"Would love to see better signing for the visitor's center ... we would have missed it if we hadn't stopped for this survey, and asked the people handing out the information!"
"Wow, this was a long survey. I was from texas visiting the oregon / washington area. Enjoyed my time at the refuge."
"Years ago when we first got married there where about four of our families that would go to kirwin to camp for the weekend. We all really enjoyed this. My husband and i have missed camping there, and we know there are others that feel the same way. I knowthere is camping in the town. But every real camper knows camping on the lake with the sunset, sunrise, and late night lights on the water are the best. Please think about letting people camp on the lake again."
"You are doing a good job. Keep up the good work. We love to come back."
"You should include options for people to report sex that is non-binary. It is poor form to leave only options for self-reported identity as male or female."
"Your refuge is a gem in this area and we can only imagine how much wildlife would be in this area if it was even larger. Thank you so much for all the work done to keep this one beautiful. I'm not sure what could be done with the north end wooded tree lined area but it would be nice to attract more waterfowl there. We love going to the badlands, custer state park & wind cave, sd & big horn mountains & yellowstone national park, wy. Grand island & kearney, ne. have the areas for watching the crane migrations too. So we go to many places and can tell you, this refuge is great. Thank you, marty & lisa"
"Your survey is much to long , too many questions , will not take a survey again"
"Your survey is way too long"
